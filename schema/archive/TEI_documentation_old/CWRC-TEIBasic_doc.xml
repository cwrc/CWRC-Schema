          conceived of as a simple demonstration of how the TEI encoding scheme
          might be adopted to meet 90% of the needs of 90% of the TEI user
          community. In retrospect, it was predictable that many people should
          imagine TEI Lite to be all there is to TEI, or find TEI Lite to be far
          too heavy for their needs.</p><p>The original TEI Lite was based largely on observations of existing
          and previous practice in the encoding of texts, particularly as
          manifest in the collections of the <ref target="http://ota.ahds.ac.uk">Oxford Text Archive</ref> and in our own experience. It is
          therefore unsurprising that it seems to have become, if not a de facto
          standard, at least a common point of departure for electronic text
          centres and encoding projects world wide. Maybe the fact that we
          actually produced this shortish, readable, manual for it also
          helped.</p><p>Early adopters of TEI Lite included a number of <soCalled>Electronic
            Text Centers</soCalled>, many of whom produced their own
          documentation and tutorial materials (some examples are listed in <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Tutorials">the TEI Tutorials
            pages</ref>). It was also widely adopted as the basis for
          TEI-conformant authoring systems. Documentation introducing TEI Lite
          has been widely used for tutorial purposes and has been widely
          translated (see further the list of versions at <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/Lite/"/>).</p><p>With the publication of TEI P4, the XML version of the TEI
          Guidelines, which uses the generation of TEI Lite as an example of the
          modification mechanism built into the TEI Guidelines, the opportunity
          was taken to produce a lightly revised XML-conformant version, but the
          present revision is the first substantively changed version since its
          first appearance in 1997. This revision takes advantage of the many
          new features introduced into the TEI Guidelines at release P5. A brief

 </p><div xml:id="U5-Intro"><head>Introduction</head><p>The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines are addressed to anyone
          who wants to interchange information stored in an electronic form.
          They emphasize the interchange of textual information, but other forms
          of information such as images and sound are also addressed. The
          Guidelines are equally applicable in the creation of new resources and
          in the interchange of existing ones.</p><p>The Guidelines provide a means of making explicit certain features of
          a text in such a way as to aid the processing of that text by computer
          programs running on different machines. This process of making
          explicit we call <term>markup</term> or <term>encoding</term>. Any
          textual representation on a computer uses some form of markup; the TEI
          came into being partly because of the enormous variety of mutually
          incomprehensible encoding schemes currently besetting scholarship, and
          partly because of the expanding range of scholarly uses now being
          identified for texts in electronic form.</p><p>The TEI Guidelines describe an encoding scheme which can be expressed
          using a number of different formal languages. The first editions of
          the Guidelines used the <term>Standard Generalized Markup
            Language</term> (SGML); since 2002, this has been replaced by the
          use of the Extensible Markup Language (XML). These markup languages
          have in common the definition of text in terms of
            <term>elements</term> and <term>attributes</term>, and rules
          governing their appearance within a text. The TEI's use of XML is
          ambitious in its complexity and generality, but it is fundamentally no
          different from that of any other XML markup scheme, and so any
          general-purpose XML-aware software is able to process TEI-conformant
          texts.</p><p>The TEI was sponsored by the Association for Computers and the
          Humanities, the Association for Computational Linguistics, and the
          Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing, and is now
          maintained and developed by an independent membership consortium,
          hosted by four major Universities. Funding has been provided in part
          from the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities, Directorate
          General XIII of the Commission of the European Communities, the Andrew
          W. Mellon Foundation, and the Social Science and Humanities Research
          Council of Canada. The Guidelines were first published in May 1994,
          after six years of development involving many hundreds of scholars
          from different academic disciplines worldwide. During the years that
          followed, the Guidelines were increasingly influential in the
          development of the digital library, in the language industries, and
          even in the development of the World Wide Web itself. The TEI
          consortium was set up in January 2001, and a year later produced an
          edition of the Guidelines entirely revised for XML compatibility. In
          2004, it set about a major revision of the Guidelines to take full
          advantage of new schema languages, the first release of which appeared
          in 2005. This revision of the TEI Lite manual conforms to version 0.3
          of this most recent edition of the Guidelines, TEI P5.</p><p>At the outset of its work, the overall goals of the TEI were defined
          by the closing statement of a planning conference held at Vassar
          College, N.Y., in November, 1987; these <soCalled>Poughkeepsie
            Principles</soCalled> were further elaborated in a series of design
          documents. The Guidelines, say these design documents, should:
              <list><item>suffice to represent the textual features needed for
              research;</item><item>be simple, clear, and
              concrete;</item><item>be easy for researchers to use without
              special-purpose software;</item><item>allow the rigorous
              definition and efficient processing of texts;</item><item>provide
              for user-defined extensions;</item><item>conform to existing and
              emergent standards.</item></list></p><p>The world of scholarship is large and diverse. For the Guidelines to
          have wide acceptability, it was important to ensure that: <list type="ordered"><item>the common core of textual features be easily
              shared;</item><item>additional specialist features be easy to add
              to (or remove from) a text;</item><item>multiple parallel
              encodings of the same feature should be possible;</item><item>the
              richness of markup should be user-defined, with a very small
              minimal requirement;</item><item>adequate documentation of the
              text and its encoding should be provided.</item></list></p><p>The present document describes a manageable selection from the
          extensive set of elements and recommendations resulting from those
          design goals, which is called <title>TEI Lite</title>.</p><p>In selecting from the several hundred elements defined by the full
          TEI scheme, we have tried to identify a useful <soCalled>starter
            set</soCalled>, comprising the elements which almost every user
          should know about. Experience working with TEI Lite will be invaluable
          in understanding the full TEI scheme and in knowing how to integrate
          specialized parts of it into the general TEI framework.</p><p>Our goals in defining this subset may be summarized as follows: <list type="simple"><item>it should be able to handle adequately a
              reasonably wide variety of texts, at the level of detail found in
              existing practice (as demonstrated in, for example, the holdings
              of the Oxford Text Archive);</item><item>it should be useful for
              the production of new documents (such as this one) as well as the
              encoding of existing texts;</item><item>it should be usable with a
              wide range of existing XML software;</item><item>it should be
              derivable from the full TEI scheme using the extension mechanisms
              described in the TEI Guidelines;</item><item>it should be as small
              and simple as is consistent with the other goals.</item></list>
        </p><p>The reader may judge our success in meeting these goals for him or
          herself. At the time of first writing (1995), our confidence that we
          have at least partially done so is borne out by its use in practice
          for the encoding of real texts. The Oxford Text Archive uses TEI Lite
          when it translates texts from its holdings from their original markup
          schemes into SGML; the Electronic Text Centers at the University of
          Virginia and the University of Michigan have used TEI Lite to encode
          their holdings. And the Text Encoding Initiative itself uses TEI Lite,
          in its current technical documentation — including this
          document. </p><p>Although we have tried to make this document self-contained, as suits
          a tutorial text, the reader should be aware that it does not cover
          every detail of the TEI encoding scheme. All of the elements described
          here are fully documented in the TEI Guidelines themselves, which
          should be consulted for authoritative reference information on these,
          and on the many others which are not described here. Some basic
          knowledge of XML is assumed.</p></div><div xml:id="U5-eg"><head>A Short Example</head><p>We begin with a short example, intended to show what happens when a
          passage of prose is typed into a computer by someone with little sense
          of the purpose of mark-up, or the potential of electronic texts. In an
          ideal world, such output might be generated by a very accurate optical
          scanner. It attempts to be faithful to the appearance of the printed
          text, by retaining the original line breaks, by introducing blanks to
          represent the layout of the original headings and page breaks, and so
          forth. Where characters not available on the keyboard are needed (such
          as the accented letter <mentioned>a</mentioned> in
            <mentioned>faàl</mentioned> or the long dash), it attempts to
          mimic their appearance.</p><p><eg> CHAPTER 38 READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and
            I, the par- son and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from
            church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was
            cooking the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said --
            'Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.' The
            housekeeper and her husband were of that decent, phlegmatic order of
            people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable
            piece of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears
            pierced by some shrill ejaculation and subsequently stunned by a
            torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did stare at
            me; the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting
            at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air, and
            for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the
            polishing process; but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only
            -- 'Have you, miss? Well, for sure!' A short time after she pursued,
            'I seed you go out with the master, but I didn't know you were gone
            to church to be wed'; and she basted away. John, when I turned to
            him, was grinning from ear to ear. 'I telled Mary how it would be,'
            he said: 'I knew what Mr Ed- ward' (John was an old servant, and had
            known his master when he was the cadet of the house, therefore he
            often gave him his Christian name) -- 'I knew what Mr Edward would
            do; and I was certain he would not wait long either: and he's done
            right, for aught I know. I wish you joy, miss!' and he politely
            pulled his forelock. 'Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give
            you and Mary this.' I put into his hand a five-pound note. Without
            waiting to hear more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of
            that sanctum some time after, I caught the words -- 'She'll happen
            do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.' And again, 'If she
            ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faa\l, and varry
            good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see
            that.' I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say
            what I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana
            and 474 JANE EYRE 475 Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana
            announced that she would just give me time to get over the
            honeymoon, and then she would come and see me. 'She had better not
            wait till then, Jane,' said Mr Rochester, when I read her letter to
            him; 'if she does, she will be too late, for our honey- moon will
            shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your grave or
            mine.' How St John received the news I don't know: he never answered
            the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote
            to me, without, however, mentioning Mr Rochester's name or allud-
            ing to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and though very
            serious, kind. He has maintained a regular, though not very frequent
            correspond- ence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am
            not of those who live without God in the world, and only mind
            earthly things.</eg></p><p>This transcription suffers from a number of shortcomings:

              the use of white space, and hard carriage returns have been
              introduced at the end of each line. Consequently, if the size of
              type used to print the text changes, reformatting will be

          us to represent the following distinctions: <list><item>Paragraph and
              chapter divisions are now marked
              explicitly.</item><item>Apostrophes are distinguished from
              quotation marks; direct speech is explicitly

              of the original has not been retained and words broken by
              typographic accident at the end of a line have been re-assembled
              without comment.</item><item>For convenience of proof reading, a
              new line has been introduced at the start of each paragraph, but

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><pb n="474"/><div type="chapter" n="38"><p>Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we
                had: he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present. When we
                got back from church, I went into the kitchen of the
                manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner, and John
                cleaning the knives, and I said —</p><p><q>Mary, I have
                  been married to Mr Rochester this morning.</q> The housekeeper
                and her husband were of that decent, phlegmatic order of people,
                to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable
                piece of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears
                pierced by some shrill ejaculation and subsequently stunned by a
                torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did stare
                at me; the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens
                roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended
                in air, and for the same space of time John's knives also had
                rest from the polishing process; but Mary, bending again over
                the roast, said only —</p><p><q>Have you, miss? Well, for
                  sure!</q></p><p>A short time after she pursued, <q>I seed you
                  go out with the master, but I didn't know you were gone to
                  church to be wed</q>; and she basted away. John, when I turned
                to him, was grinning from ear to ear. <q>I telled Mary how it
                  would be,</q> he said: <q>I knew what Mr Edward</q> (John was
                an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet
                of the house, therefore he often gave him his Christian name)
                — <q>I knew what Mr Edward would do; and I was certain he
                  would not wait long either: and he's done right, for aught I
                  know. I wish you joy, miss!</q> and he politely pulled his
                forelock.</p><p><q>Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give
                  you and Mary this.</q></p><p>I put into his hand a five-pound
                note. Without waiting to hear more, I left the kitchen. In
                passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I caught the
                words —</p><p><q>She'll happen do better for him nor ony
                  o' t' grand ladies.</q> And again, <q>If she ben't one o' th'
                  handsomest, she's noan faàl, and varry good-natured; and
                  i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see
                that.</q></p><p>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge
                immediately, to say what I had done: fully explaining also why I
                had thus acted. Diana and <pb n="475"/> Mary approved the step
                unreservedly. Diana announced that she would just give me time
                to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see
                me.</p><p><q>She had better not wait till then, Jane,</q> said
                Mr Rochester, when I read her letter to him; <q>if she does, she
                  will be too late, for our honeymoon will shine our life long:
                  its beams will only fade over your grave or
                mine.</q></p><p>How St John received the news I don't know: he
                never answered the letter in which I communicated it: yet six
                months after he wrote to me, without, however, mentioning Mr
                Rochester's name or alluding to my marriage. His letter was then
                calm, and though very serious, kind. He has maintained a
                regular, though not very frequent correspondence ever since: he
                hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without
                God in the world, and only mind earthly
            things.</p></div></egXML></p><p>This particular encoding represents a set of choices or priorities.
          The decision to focus on Brontë's text, rather than on the
          printing of it in this particular edition, is an instance of the
          fundamental <emph>selectivity</emph> of any encoding. An encoding
          makes explicit only those textual features of importance to the
          encoder. It is not difficult to think of ways in which the encoding of
          even this short passage might readily be extended. For example: <list type="simple"><item>a regularized form of the passages in dialect
              could be provided;</item><item>footnotes glossing or commenting on
              any passage could be added;</item><item>pointers linking parts of
              this text to others could be added;</item><item>proper names of
              various kinds could be distinguished from the surrounding
              text;</item><item>detailed bibliographic information about the
              text's provenance and context could be prefixed to
              it;</item><item>a linguistic analysis of the passage into
              sentences, clauses, words, etc., could be provided, each unit
              being associated with appropriate category codes;</item><item>the
              text could be segmented into narrative or discourse
              units;</item><item>systematic analysis or interpretation of the
              text could be included in the encoding, with potentially complex
              alignment or linkage between the text and the analysis, or between
              the text and one or more translations of it;</item><item>passages
              in the text could be linked to images or sound held on other
              media.</item></list></p><p>A TEI-recommended way of carrying out most of these is described in
          the remainder of this document. The TEI scheme as a whole also
          provides for an enormous range of other possibilities, of which we
          cite only a few: <list type="simple"><item>detailed analysis of the
              components of names;</item><item>detailed meta-information
              providing thesaurus-style information about the text's origins or
              topics;</item><item>information about the printing history or
              manuscript variations exhibited by a particular series of versions
              of the text.</item></list> For recommendations on these and many
          other possibilities, the full Guidelines should be consulted.</p></div><div xml:id="U5-struc"><head>The Structure of a TEI Text</head><p>All TEI-conformant texts contain (a) a <term>TEI header</term>
          (marked up as a <gi>teiHeader</gi> element) and (b) the transcription
          of the text proper (marked up as a <gi>text</gi> element). These two
          elements are combined together to form a single <gi>TEI</gi> element. </p><p>The TEI header provides information analogous to that provided by the
          title page of a printed text. It has up to four parts: a bibliographic
          description of the machine-readable text, a description of the way it
          has been encoded, a non-bibliographic description of the text (a
            <term>text profile</term>), and a revision history. The header is
          described in more detail in section <ptr target="#U5-header"/>.</p><p>A TEI text may be <term>unitary</term> (a single work) or
            <term>composite</term> (a collection of single works, such as an
          anthology). In either case, the text may have an optional
            <term>front</term> or <term>back</term>. In between is the
            <term>body</term> of the text, which, in the case of a composite
          text, may consist of <term>group</term>s, each containing more groups
          or texts.</p><p>A unitary text will be encoded using an overall structure like this:
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><TEI><teiHeader><!-- [ TEI Header information ]  --></teiHeader><text><front><!-- [ front matter ... ] --></front><body><!-- [ body of text ... ]  --></body><back><!--  [ back matter ...  ] --></back></text></TEI></egXML></p><p>A composite text also has an optional front and back. In between
          occur one or more groups of texts, each with its own optional front
          and back matter. A composite text will thus be encoded using an
          overall structure like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><TEI><teiHeader><!--[ header information for the composite ]--></teiHeader><text><front><!--[ front matter for the composite  ]--></front><group><text><front><!--[ front matter of first text ]--></front><body><!--[ body of first text  ]--></body><back><!--[ back matter of first text ]--></back></text><text><front><!--[ front matter of second text]--></front><body><!--[ body of second text  ]--></body><back><!--[ back matter of second text ]--></back></text><!--[ more texts or groups of texts here ]--></group><back><!--[ back matter for the composite  ]--></back></text></TEI></egXML></p><p>It is also possible to define a composite of TEI texts, each with its
          own header. Such a collection is known as a <term>TEI corpus</term>,
          and may itself have a header: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiCorpus><teiHeader><!--[header information for the corpus]--></teiHeader><TEI><teiHeader><!--[header information for first text]--></teiHeader><text><!--[first text in corpus]--></text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader><!--[header information for second text]--></teiHeader><text><!--[second text in corpus]--></text></TEI></teiCorpus></egXML>
          It is not however possible to create a composite of corpora -- that
          is, a number of <gi>teiCorpus</gi> elements combined together and
          treated as a single object. This is a restriction of the current
          version of the TEI Guidelines.</p><p>In the remainder of this document, we discuss chiefly simple text
          structures. The discussion in each case consists of a short list of
          relevant TEI <term>elements</term> with a brief definition of each,
          followed by definitions for any <term>attributes</term> specific to
          that element, and a reference to any <term>classes</term> of which the
          element is a member. These references are linked to full
          specifications for each object, as given in the TEI
            <title>Guidelines</title>. In most cases, short examples are also
          given.</p><p>For example, here are the elements discussed so far:
              <specList><specDesc key="TEI"/><specDesc key="teiHeader"/><specDesc key="text"/></specList></p></div><div xml:id="U5-body"><head>Encoding the Body</head><p>As indicated above, a simple TEI document at the textual level
          consists of the following elements: <specList><specDesc key="front"/><specDesc key="group"/><specDesc key="body"/><specDesc key="back"/></specList> Elements specific to front and back matter
          are described below in section <ptr target="#U5-fronbac"/>. In this
          section we discuss the elements making up the body of a text. </p><div xml:id="divs"><head>Text Division Elements</head><p>The body of a prose text may be just a series of paragraphs, or
            these paragraphs may be grouped together into chapters, sections,
            subsections, etc. Each paragraph is tagged using the <gi>p</gi> tag.
            The <gi>div</gi> element is used to represent any such grouping of
            paragraphs. <specList><specDesc key="p"/><specDesc key="div"/></specList>
          </p><p>The <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>div</gi> element may be
            used to supply a conventional name for this category of text
            division, or otherwise distinguish them. Typical values might be
              <q>book</q>, <q>chapter</q>, <q>section</q>, <q>part</q>,
              <q>poem</q>, <q>song</q>, etc. For a given project, it will
            usually be advisable to define and adhere to a specific list of such
            values. </p><p>A <gi>div</gi> element may itself contain further, nested,
              <gi>div</gi>s, thus mimicking the traditional structure of a book,
            which can be decomposed hierarchically into units such as parts,
            containing chapters, containing sections, and so on. TEI texts in
            general conform to this simple hierarchic model.</p><p> The <att>xml:id</att> attribute may be used to supply a unique
            identifier for the division, which may be used for cross references
            or other links to it, such as a commentary, as further discussed in
            section <ptr target="#U5-ptrs"/>. It is often useful to provide an
              <att>xml:id</att> attribute for every major structural unit in a
            text, and to derive its values in some systematic way, for example
            by appending a section number to a short code for the title of the
            work in question, as in the examples below.</p><p>The <att>n</att> attribute may be used to supply (additionally or
            alternatively) a short mnemonic name or number for the division. If
            a conventional form of reference or abbreviation for the parts of a
            work already exists (such as the book/chapter/verse pattern of
            Biblical citations), the <att>n</att> attribute is the place to
            record it.</p><p>The <att>xml:lang</att> attribute may be used to specify the
            language of the division. Languages are identified by an
            internationally defined code, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#z636"/> below.</p><p>The <att>rend</att> attribute may be used to supply information
            about the rendition (appearance) of a division, or any other
            element, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-hilites"/>
            below. As with the <att>type</att> attribute, a project will often
            find it useful to predefine the possible values for this attribute,
            but TEI Lite does not constrain it in anyway. </p><p> These four attributes, <att>xml:id</att>, <att>n</att>,
              <att>xml:lang</att>, and <att>rend</att> are so widely useful that
            they are allowed on any element in any TEI schema: they are
              <term>global attributes</term>. Other global attributes defined in
            the TEI Lite scheme are discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p><p>The value of every <att>xml:id</att> attribute should be unique
            within a document. One simple way of ensuring that this is so is to
            make it reflect the hierarchic structure of the document. For
            example, Smith's <title>Wealth of Nations</title> as first published
            consists of five books, each of which is divided into chapters,
            while some chapters are further subdivided into parts. We might
            define <att>xml:id</att> values for this structure as follows:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body><div xml:id="WN1" n="I" type="book"><div xml:id="WN101" n="I.1" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="WN102" n="I.2" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><!-- ... --><div xml:id="WN110" n="I.10" type="chapter"><div xml:id="WN1101" n="I.10.1" type="part"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="WN1102" n="I.10.2" type="part"><!-- ... --></div></div><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="WN2" n="II" type="book"><!-- ... --></div></body></egXML></p><p>A different numbering scheme may be used for <att>xml:id</att> and
              <att>n</att> attributes: this is often useful where a canonical
            reference scheme is used which does not tally with the structure of
            the work. For example, in a novel divided into books each containing
            chapters, where the chapters are numbered sequentially through the
            whole work, rather than within each book, one might use a scheme
            such as the following: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body><div xml:id="TS01" n="1" type="Volume"><div xml:id="TS011" n="1" type="Chapter"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="TS012" n="2"><!-- ... --></div></div><div xml:id="TS02" n="2" type="Volume"><div xml:id="TS021" n="3" type="Chapter"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="TS022" n="4"><!-- ... --></div></div></body></egXML> Here the work has
            two volumes, each containing two chapters. The chapters are numbered
            conventionally 1 to 4, but the <att>xml:id</att> values specified
            allow them to be regarded additionally as if they were numbered 1.1,
            1.2, 2.1, 2.2.</p></div><div xml:id="h25"><head>Headings and Closings</head><p>Every <gi>div</gi> may have a title or heading at its start, and
            (less commonly) a closing such as <q>End of Chapter 1</q>. The
            following elements may be used to transcribe them:
                <specList><specDesc key="head"/><specDesc key="trailer"/></specList> Some other elements which may be necessary at the
            beginning or ending of text divisions are discussed below in section
              <ptr target="#h52"/>.</p><p>Whether or not headings and trailers are included in a
            transcription is a matter for the individual transcriber to decide.
            Where a heading is completely regular (for example <q>Chapter 1</q>)
            or may be automatically constructed from attribute values (e.g.
              <gi>div type="Chapter" n="1"</gi>), it may be omitted; where it
            contains otherwise unrecoverable text it should always be included.
            For example, the start of Hardy's <title>Under the Greenwood
              Tree</title> might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div xml:id="UGT1" n="Winter" type="Part"><div xml:id="UGT11" n="1" type="Chapter"><head>Mellstock-Lane</head><p>To dwellers in a wood almost
                    every species of tree ... </p></div></div></egXML></p></div><div xml:id="vedr"><head>Prose, Verse and Drama</head><p>As noted above, the paragraphs making up a textual division should
            be tagged with the <gi>p</gi> tag. For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>I fully appreciate
                Gen. Pope's splendid achievements with their invaluable results;
                but you must know that Major Generalships in the Regular Army,
                are not as plenty as blackberries. </p></egXML>

          the text, not a span of text. The global <att>n</att> attribute should
          be used to supply the number of the page or line beginning at the tag. </p><p>When working from a paginated original, it is often useful to record
          its pagination, if only to simplify later proof-reading. Recording the
          line breaks may be useful for the same reason; treatment of
          end-of-line hyphenation in printed source texts will require some
          consideration.</p><p>If pagination, etc., are marked for more than one edition, specify
          the edition in question using the <att>ed</att> attribute, and supply

          but can mark any kind of reference point: for example, a column break,
          the start of a new kind of section not otherwise tagged, or in general
          any significant change in the text not marked by an XML element. The

            the rest of the text, typically by a change of type font,

            reader's attention to some associated change.</p><p>The global <att>rend</att> attribute can be attached to any
            element, and used wherever necessary to specify details of the
            highlighting used for it. For example, a heading rendered in bold
            might be tagged <gi>head rend="bold"</gi>, and one in italic
              <gi>head rend="italic"</gi>.</p><p>It is not always possible or desirable to interpret the reasons for
            such changes of rendering in a text. In such cases, the element

            discussed in the following section) should be used. If the rendition

            to denote several different features within a text, of which the
            most frequent is quotation. When possible, we recommend that the
            underlying feature be tagged, rather than the simple fact that
            quotation marks appear in the text, using the following elements:
                <specList><specDesc key="q"/><specDesc key="quote"/><specDesc key="mentioned"/><specDesc key="soCalled"/><specDesc key="gloss"/></specList>
          </p><p>Here is a simple example of a quotation: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>Few dictionary makers
                are likely to forget Dr. Johnson's description of the
                lexicographer as <q>a harmless drudge.</q></p></egXML>
          </p><p>To record how a quotation was printed (for example,
              <term>in-line</term> or set off as a <term>display</term> or
              <term>block quotation</term>), the <att>rend</att> attribute
            should be used. This may also be used to indicate the kind of
            quotation marks used.</p><p>Direct speech interrupted by a narrator can be represented simply
            by ending the quotation and beginning it again after the
            interruption, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><q>Who-e debel
                  you?</q> — he at last said — <q>you no speak-e,
                  damme, I kill-e.</q> And so saying, the lighted tomahawk began
                flourishing about me in the dark.</p></egXML> If it is important
            to convey the idea that the two <gi>q</gi> elements together make up
            a single speech, the linking attributes <att>next</att> and
              <att>prev</att> may be used, as described in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p><p>Quotations may be accompanied by a reference to the source or
            speaker, using the <att>who</att> attribute, whether or not the
            source is given in the text, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q who="Wilson">Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight
                weeks with this very paper in his hand, and he says:—<q who="Spaulding">I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a
                  red-headed man.</q></q></egXML> This example also demonstrates
            how quotations may be embedded within other quotations: one speaker
            (Wilson) quotes another speaker (Spaulding).</p><p>The creator of the electronic text must decide whether quotation
            marks are replaced by the tags or whether the tags are added and the
            quotation marks kept. If the quotation marks are removed from the
            text, the <att>rend</att> attribute may be used to record the way in
            which they were rendered in the copy text.</p><p>As with highlighting, it is not always possible and may not be
            considered desirable to interpret the function of quotation marks in
            a text in this way. In such cases, the tag <gi>hi rend="quoted"</gi>
            might be used to mark quoted text without making any claim as to its
            status.</p></div><div xml:id="z636"><head>Foreign Words or Expressions</head><p>Words or phrases which are not in the main language of the texts
            may be tagged as such in one of two ways. If the word or phrase is
            already tagged for some reason, the element indicated should bear a
            value for the global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute indicating the
            language used. Where there is no applicable element, the element
              <gi>foreign</gi> may be used, again using the <att>xml:lang</att>
            attribute. For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>John has real <foreign xml:lang="fra">savoir-faire</foreign>.</p><p>Have you read
                  <title xml:lang="deu">Die

                court issued a writ of <term xml:lang="lat">mandamus</term>.</p></egXML></p><p>As these examples show, the <gi>foreign</gi> element should not be
            used to tag foreign words if some other more specific element such
            as <gi>title</gi>, <gi>mentioned</gi>, or <gi>term</gi> applies. The
            global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute may be attached to any element
            to show that it uses some other language than that of the
            surrounding text.</p><p>The codes used to identify languages, supplied on the
              <att>xml:lang</att> attribute, must be constructed in a particular
            way, and must conform to common Internet standards<note place="foot">The relevant standards are RFC 3066, and the lists of two and

          elements described in this section. Implicit links (such as the
          association between two parallel texts, or that between a text and its
          interpretation) may be encoded using the linking attributes discussed
          in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p><div xml:id="ptrs"><head>Simple Cross References</head><p>A cross reference from one point within a single document to
            another can be encoded using either of the following elements:
                <specList><specDesc key="ref"/><specDesc key="ptr"/></specList>
          </p><p>The difference between these two elements is that <gi>ptr</gi> is
            an empty element, simply marking a point from which a link is to be
            made, whereas <gi>ref</gi> may contain some text as well —
            typically the text of the cross-reference itself. The <gi>ptr</gi>
            element would be used for a cross reference which is to be indicated
            by some non-verbal means such as a symbol or icon, or in an
            electronic text by a button. It is also useful in document
            production systems, where the formatter can generate the correct
            verbal form of the cross reference.</p><p>The following two forms, for example, are logically equivalent
            (assuming we have documented somewhere the exact verbal form of
            cross references represented by <gi>ptr</gi> elements): <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ref target="#SEC12">section 12 on page 34</ref>.</egXML>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ptr target="#SEC12"/>.</egXML> The value of the <att>target</att>
            attribute must have been used as the identifier of some other
            element within the current document. This implies that the passage
            or phrase being pointed at must bear an identifier, and must
            therefore be tagged as an element of some kind. In the following
            example, the cross reference is to a <gi>div</gi> element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... see especially <ptr target="#SEC12"/>. ... <div xml:id="SEC12"><head>Concerning
                  Identifiers</head><!-- ... --></div></egXML>
          </p><p>Because the <att>xml:id</att> attribute is global, any element in a
            document may be pointed to in this way. In the following example, a
            paragraph has been given an identifier so that it may be pointed at:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... this is
              discussed in <ref target="#pspec">the paragraph on links</ref> ...
                <p xml:id="pspec">Links may be made to any kind of element
                ...</p></egXML></p><p>Sometimes the target of a cross reference does not correspond with
            any particular feature of a text, and so may not be tagged as an
            element of some kind. If the desired target is simply a point in the
            current document, the easiest way to mark it is by introducing an
              <gi>anchor</gi> element at the appropriate spot. If the target is
            some sequence of words not otherwise tagged, the <gi>seg</gi>
            element may be introduced to mark them. These two elements are
            described as follows: <specList><specDesc key="anchor"/><specDesc key="seg"/></specList>
          </p><p>In the following (imaginary) example, <gi>ref</gi> elements have
            been used to represent points in this text which are to be linked in
            some way to other parts of it; in the first case to a point, and in
            the second, to a sequence of words: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> Returning to <ref target="#ABCD">the point where I dozed off</ref>, I noticed that
                <ref target="#EFGH">three words</ref> had been circled in red by
              a previous reader</egXML></p><p>This encoding requires that elements with the specified identifiers
              (<att>ABCD</att> and <att>EFGH</att> in this example) are to be
            found somewhere else in the current document. Assuming that no
            element already exists to carry these identifiers, the
              <gi>anchor</gi> and <gi>seg</gi> elements may be used: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> .... <anchor type="bookmark" xml:id="ABCD"/> .... ....<seg type="target" xml:id="EFGH"> ... </seg> ...</egXML></p><p>The <att>type</att> attribute should be used (as above) to
            distinguish amongst different purposes for which these general
            purpose elements might be used in a text. Some other uses are
            discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> below.</p></div><div xml:id="xptrs"><head>Pointing to other documents</head><p>So far, we have shown how the elements <gi>ptr</gi> and
              <gi>ref</gi> may be used for cross-references or links whose
            targets occur within the same document as their source. However, the
            same elements may also be used to refer to elements in any other XML
            document or resource, such as a document on the web, or a database
            component. This is possible because the value of the
              <att>target</att> attribute may be any valid <term>universal
              resource indicator</term> (URI). A full definition of this term,
            defined by the W3C (the consortium which manages the development and
            maintenance of the World Wide Web), is beyond the scope of this
            tutorial: however, the most frequently encountered version of a URI
            is the familiar <soCalled>URL</soCalled> used to indicate a web
            page, such as <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code>. </p><p>A URL may reference a web page or just a part of one, for example
              <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml#SEC2</code>. The sharp sign
            indicates that what follows it is the identifier of an element to be
            located within the XML document identified by what precedes it: this
            example will therefore locate an element which has an
              <att>xml:id</att> attribute value of <val>SEC2</val> within the
            document retrieved from <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code>.
            In the examples we have discussed so far, the part to the left of
            the sharp sign has been omitted: this is understood to mean that the
            referenced element is to be located within the current document.</p><p>Within a URL, parts of an XML document can be specified by means of
            other more sophisticated mechanisms, using a special language called
            Xpath, also defined by the W3C. This is particularly useful where
            the elements to be linked to do not bear identifiers and must
            therefore be located by some other means. A full specification of
            the language is well beyond the scope of this document; here we
            provide only a flavour of its power. </p><p>In the XPath language, locations are defined as a series of
              <term>steps</term>, each one identifying some part of the
            document, often in terms of the locations identified by the previous
            step. For example, you would point to the third sentence of the
            second paragraph of chapter two by selecting chapter two in the
            first step, the second paragraph in the second step, and the third
            sentence in the last step. A step can be defined in terms of the
            document tree itself, using such concepts as <val>parent</val>,
              <val>descendent</val>, <val>preceding</val>, etc. or, more
            loosely, in terms of text patterns, word or character positions.

            defined for every element in the TEI Lite scheme: <list type="gloss"><label><att>ana</att></label><item>links an element with its
                interpretation.</item><label><att>corresp</att></label><item>links
                an element with one or more other corresponding
                  elements.</item><label><att>next</att></label><item>links an
                element to the next element in an

                element to the previous element in an
            aggregate.</item></list></p><p>The <att>ana</att> (analysis) attribute is intended for use where a
            set of abstract analyses or interpretations have been defined
            somewhere within a document, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-anal"/>. For example, a linguistic analysis of the
            sentence <q>John loves Nancy</q> might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg type="sentence" ana="SVO"><seg type="lex" ana="#NP1">John</seg><seg type="lex" ana="#VVI">loves</seg><seg type="lex" ana="#NP1">Nancy</seg></seg></egXML> This encoding implies the existence
            elsewhere in the document of elements with identifiers
              <val>SVO</val>, <val>NP1</val>, and <val>VV1</val> where the
            significance of these particular codes is explained. Note the use of
            the <gi>seg</gi> element to mark particular components of the
            analysis, distinguished by the <att>type</att> attribute.</p><p>The <att>corresp</att> (corresponding) attribute provides a simple
            way of representing some form of correspondence between two elements
            in a text. For example, in a multilingual text, it may be used to
            link translation equivalents, as in the following example <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg xml:lang="fra" xml:id="FR1" corresp="#EN1">Jean aime Nancy</seg><seg xml:lang="en" xml:id="EN1" corresp="#FR1">John loves
              Nancy</seg></egXML></p><p>The same mechanism may be used for a variety of purposes. In the
            following example, it has been used to represent anaphoric
            correspondences between <q rend="inline" type="inline">the show</q>
            and <q>Shirley</q>, and between <q>NBC</q> and <q>the network</q>:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><title xml:id="shirley">Shirley</title>, which made its Friday night
                debut only a month ago, was not listed on <name xml:id="nbc">NBC</name>'s new schedule, although <seg xml:id="network" corresp="#nbc">the network</seg> says <seg xml:id="show" corresp="#shirley">the show</seg> still is being
                considered.</p></egXML></p><p>The <att>next</att> and <att>prev</att> attributes provide a simple
            way of linking together the components of a discontinuous element,
            as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q xml:id="Q1a" next="#Q1b">Who-e debel you?</q> — he at last said
              — <q xml:id="Q1b" prev="#Q1a">you no speak-e, damme, I
                kill-e.</q> And so saying, the lighted tomahawk began
              flourishing about me in the dark.</egXML></p></div></div><div xml:id="U5-edit1"><head>Editorial Interventions</head><p>The process of encoding an electronic text has much in common with
          the process of editing a manuscript or other text for printed
          publication. In either case a conscientious editor may wish to record
          both the original state of the source and any editorial correction or
          other change made in it. The elements discussed in this and the next
          section provide some facilities for meeting these needs.</p><div><head>Correction and Normalization</head><p>The following elements may be used to mark <term>correction</term>,
            that is editorial changes introduced where the editor believes the
            original to be erroneous: <specList><specDesc key="corr"/><specDesc key="sic"/></specList>
          </p><p>The following elements may be used to mark
              <term>normalization</term>, that is editorial changes introduced
            for the sake of consistency or modernization of a text:
                <specList><specDesc key="orig"/><specDesc key="reg"/></specList></p><p>As an example, consider this extract from the quarto printing of
            Shakespeare's <title>Henry V</title>. <eg> ... for his nose was as
              sharp as a pen and a table of green feelds</eg>
          </p><p>A modern editor might wish to make a number of interventions here,
            specifically to modernize (or normalise) the Elizabethan spellings
            of <mentioned>a'</mentioned> and <mentioned>feelds</mentioned> for
              <mentioned>he</mentioned> and <mentioned>fields</mentioned>
            respectively. He or she might also want to emend
              <mentioned>table</mentioned> to <mentioned>babbl'd</mentioned>,
            following an editorial tradition that goes back to the 18th century
            Shakesperean scholar Theobald. The following encoding would then be
            appropriate: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for
              his nose was as sharp as a pen and <reg>he</reg>
              <corr resp="#Theobald">babbl'd</corr> of green
              <reg>fields</reg></egXML></p><p>A more conservative or source-oriented editor, however, might want
            to retain the original, but at the same time signal that some of the
            readings it contains are in some sense anomalous: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his nose was as
              sharp as a pen and <orig>a</orig>
              <sic>table</sic> of green <orig>feelds</orig></egXML></p><p>Finally, a modern digital editor may decide to combine both
            possibilities in a single composite text, using the <gi>choice</gi>
            element. <specList><specDesc key="choice"/></specList> This allows
            an editor to mark where alternative readings are possible: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... for his nose was as
              sharp as a pen and <choice><orig>a</orig><reg>he</reg></choice>
              <choice><corr resp="#Theobald">babbl'd</corr><sic>table</sic></choice> of green

            </egXML></p></div><div xml:id="U5-edit2"><head>Omissions, Deletions, and Additions</head><p>In addition to correcting or normalizing words and phrases, editors
            and transcribers may also supply missing material, omit material, or
            transcribe material deleted or crossed out in the source. In
            addition, some material may be particularly hard to transcribe
            because it is hard to make out on the page. The following elements
            may be used to record such phenomena: <specList><specDesc key="add"/><specDesc key="gap"/><specDesc key="del"/><specDesc key="unclear"/></specList>
          </p><p>These elements may be used to record changes made by an editor, by
            the transcriber, or (in manuscript material) by the author or
            scribe. For example, if the source for an electronic text read
              <eg>The following elements are provided for for simple editorial
              interventions.</eg> then it might be felt desirable to correct the
            obvious error, but at the same time to record the deletion of the
            superfluous second <mentioned>for</mentioned>, thus: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">The following elements
              are provided for <del resp="#LB">for</del> simple editorial
              interventions.</egXML> The attribute value <code>LB</code> on the
              <att>resp</att> attribute indicates that <q>LB</q> corrected the
            duplication of <mentioned>for</mentioned>.</p><p>If the source read<eg>The following elements provided for simple
              editorial interventions.</eg> (i.e. if the verb had been
            inadvertently dropped) then the corrected text might read: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">The following elements
                <add resp="#LB">are</add> provided for simple editorial
              interventions.</egXML></p><p>These elements are not limited to changes made by an editor; they
            can also be used to record authorial changes in manuscripts. A
            manuscript in which the author has first written <q>How it galls me,
              what a galling shadow</q>, then crossed out the word
              <mentioned>galls</mentioned> and inserted
              <mentioned>dogs</mentioned> might be encoded thus: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">How it <del hand="DHL" type="overstrike">galls</del>
              <add hand="DHL" place="supralinear">dogs</add> me, what a galling
              shadow</egXML></p><p>Similarly, the <gi>unclear</gi> and <gi>gap</gi> elements may be
            used together to indicate the omission of illegible material; the
            following example also shows the use of <gi>add</gi> for a
            conjectural emendation: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">One hundred &amp; twenty
              good regulars joined to me <unclear><gap reason="indecipherable"/></unclear> &amp; instantly, would aid me signally <add hand="ed">in?</add> an enterprise against

            part of the electronic text despite being marked as deleted, while
              <gi>gap</gi> marks the location of material which is omitted from
            the electronic text, whether it is legible or not. A language
            corpus, for example, might omit long quotations in foreign
            languages: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p> ...

            they stand or expanded; they may be left unmarked, or encoded using
            the following elements: <specList><specDesc key="abbr"/><specDesc key="expan"/></specList>
          </p><p>The <gi>abbr</gi> element is useful as a means of distinguishing
            semi-lexical items such as acronyms or jargon: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">We can sum up the above
              discussion as follows: the identity of a <abbr>CC</abbr> is
              defined by that calibration of values which motivates the elements
              of its <abbr>GSP</abbr>;</egXML>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Every manufacturer

          </p><p>The <att>type</att> attribute may be used to distinguish types of
            abbreviation by their function. </p><p>The <gi>expan</gi> element is used to mark an expansion supplied by
            an encoder. This element is particularly useful in the transcription
            of manuscript materials. For example, the character p with a bar
            through its descender as a conventional representation for the word
              <val>per</val> is commonly encountered in Medieval European
            manuscripts. An encoder may choose to expand this as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><expan>per</expan></egXML>
          </p><p>The expansion corresponding with an abbreviated form may not always
            contain the same letters as the abbreviation. Where it does,
            however, common editorial practice is to italicize or otherwise
            signal which letters have been supplied. The <gi>expan</gi> element
            should not be used for this purpose since its function is to
            indicate an expanded form, not a part of one. For example, consider
            the common abbreviation <val>wt</val> (for <val>with</val>) found in
            medieval texts. In a modern edition, an editor might wish to
            represent this as <soCalled>w<hi>i</hi>t<hi>h</hi></soCalled>,
            italicising the letters not found in the source. An appropriate
            encoding for this purpose would be <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><expan>w<hi>i</hi>t<hi>h</hi></expan></egXML>
          </p><p>To record both an abbreviation and its expansion, the
              <gi>choice</gi> element mentioned above may be used to group the
            abbreviated form with its proposed expansion: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><choice><abbr>wt</abbr><expan>with</expan></choice></egXML>

            name prefixes such as <mentioned>van</mentioned> or <mentioned>de
              la</mentioned>, may or may not be included as part of the
            reference form of a name, depending on the language and country of
            origin of the bearer.</p><p>The <att>key</att> attribute provides an alternative normalized
            identifier for the object being named, like a database record key.
            It may thus be useful as a means of gathering together all
            references to the same individual or location scattered throughout a
            document: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>My dear
                  <rs type="person" key="BENM1">Mr. Bennet</rs>, </q> said <rs type="person" key="BENM2">his lady</rs> to him one day, <q>have
                you heard that <rs type="place" key="NETP1">Netherfield
                  Park</rs> is let at last?</q></egXML></p><p>This use should be distinguished from the case of the <gi>reg</gi>
            (regularization) element, which provides a means of marking the
            standard form of a referencing string as demonstrated below: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><name type="person" key="WADLM1"><choice><sic>Walter de la Mare</sic><reg>de la
                    Mare, Walter</reg></choice></name> was born at <name key="Ch1" type="place">Charlton</name>, in <name key="KT1" type="county">Kent</name>, in 1873.</egXML></p><p>The <gi>index</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="indexing"/>
            may be more appropriate if the function of the regularization is to
            provide a consistent index: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><name type="place">Montaillou</name> is not a large parish. At the time of the
                events which led to <name type="person">Fournier</name>'s
                    <index><term>Benedict XII, Pope of Avignon (Jacques
                    Fournier)</term></index> investigations, the local
                population consisted of between 200 and 250
              inhabitants.</p></egXML> Although adequate for many simple
            applications, these methods have two inconveniences: if the name
            occurs many times, then its regularised form must be repeated many
            times; and the burden of additional XML markup in the body of the
            text may be inconvenient to maintain and complex to process. For
            applications such as onomastics, relating to persons or places named
            rather than the name itself, or wherever a detailed analysis of the
            component parts of a name is needed, the full TEI Guidelines provide
            a range of other solutions.</p></div><div><head>Dates and Times</head><p>Tags for the more detailed encoding of times and dates include the
            following: <specList><specDesc key="date"/><specDesc key="time"/></specList>
          </p><p>The <att>value</att> attribute specifies a normalized form for the
            date or time, using one of the standard formats defined by ISO 8601.
            Partial dates or times (e.g. <q>1990</q>, <q>September 1990</q>,
              <q>twelvish</q>) can be expressed by omitting a part of the value
            supplied, as in the following examples: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date when="1980-02-21">21 Feb 1980</date><date when="1990">1990</date><date when="1990-09">September 1990</date><date when="--09">September</date><date when="2001-09-11T12:48:00">Sept 11th, 12

            use of a normalized representation for the date string which

          most straightforward text will often contain diagrams or
          illustrations, to say nothing of documents in which image and text are
          inextricably intertwined, or electronic resources in which the two are
          complementary. </p><p>The encoder may simply record the presence of a graphic within the
          text, possibly with a brief description of its content, by using the
          elements described in this section. The same elements may also be used
          to embed digitized versions of the graphic within an electronic
          document. <specList><specDesc key="graphic"/><specDesc key="figure"/><specDesc key="figDesc"/></specList></p><p>Any textual information accompanying the graphic, such as a heading
          and/or caption, may be included within the <gi>figure</gi> element
          itself, in a <gi>head</gi> and one or more <gi>p</gi> elements, as may
          also any text appearing within the graphic itself. It is strongly
          recommended that a prose description of the image be supplied, as the
          content of a <gi>figDesc</gi> element, for the use of applications
          which are not able to render the graphic, and to render the document
          accessible to vision-impaired readers. (Such text is not normally
          considered part of the document proper.)</p><p>The simplest use for these elements is to mark the position of a
          graphic and provide a link to it, as in this example; <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><pb n="412"/><graphic url="p412fig.png"/><pb n="413"/></egXML> This indicates that the
          graphic contained by the file <ident>p412fig.png</ident> appears
          between pages 412 and 413. </p><p>The <gi>graphic</gi> element can appear anywhere that textual content
          is permitted, within but not between paragraphs or headings. In the
          following example, the encoder has decided to treat a specific
          printer's ornament as a heading: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><head><graphic url="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/gants/Ornaments/Heads/hp-ral02.gif"/></head></egXML>
        </p><p>More usually, a graphic will have at the least an identifying title,
          which may be encoded using the <gi>head</gi> element, or a number of
          figures may be grouped together in a particular structure. It is also
          often convenient to include a brief description of the image. The
            <gi>figure</gi> element provides a means of wrapping one or more
          such elements together as a kind of graphic
          <soCalled>block</soCalled>: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><figure><graphic url="fessipic.png"/><head>Mr Fezziwig's Ball</head><figDesc>A

                revellers.</figDesc></figure></egXML></p><p>When a digitized version of the graphic concerned is available, it
          may be embedded at the appropriate point within the document in this
          way.</p></div><div xml:id="U5-anal"><head>Interpretation and Analysis</head><p>It is often said that <emph>all</emph> markup is a form of
          interpretation or analysis. While it is certainly difficult, and may
          be impossible, to distinguish firmly between
            <soCalled>objective</soCalled> and <soCalled>subjective</soCalled>
          information in any universal way, it remains true that judgments
          concerning the latter are typically regarded as more likely to provide
          controversy than those concerning the former. Many scholars therefore
          prefer to record such interpretations only if it is possible to alert
          the reader that they are considered more open to dispute, than the
          rest of the markup. This section describes some of the elements
          provided by the TEI scheme to meet this need. </p><div><head>Orthographic Sentences</head><p>Interpretation typically ranges across the whole of a text, with no
            particular respect to other structural units. A useful preliminary
            to intensive interpretation is therefore to segment the text into
            discrete and identifiable units, each of which can then bear a label
            for use as a sort of <soCalled>canonical reference</soCalled>. To
            facilitate such uses, these units may not cross each other, nor nest
            within each other. They may conveniently be represented using the
            following element: <specList><specDesc key="s"/></specList></p><p>As the name suggests, the <gi>s</gi> element is most commonly used
            (in linguistic applications at least) for marking <term>orthographic
              sentences</term>, that is, units defined by orthographic features
            such as punctuation. For example, the passage from <title>Jane
              Eyre</title> discussed earlier might be divided into s-units as
              follows:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><pb n="474"/><div type="chapter" n="38"><p><s n="001">Reader, I
                    married him.</s><s n="002">A quiet wedding we had:</s><s n="003">he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone
                    present.</s><s n="004">When we got back from church, I went
                    into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking
                    the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said
                    —</s></p><p><q><s n="005">Mary, I have been married
                      to Mr Rochester this morning.</s></q> ...
              </p></div></egXML> Note that <gi>s</gi> elements cannot nest: the
            beginning of one <gi>s</gi> element implies that the previous one
            has finished. When s-units are tagged as shown above, it is
            advisable to tag the entire text end-to-end, so that every word in
            the text being analysed will be contained by exactly one <gi>s</gi>
            element, whose identifier can then be used to specify a unique
            reference for it. If the identifiers used are unique within the
            document, then the <att>xml:id</att> attribute might be used in
            preference to the <att>n</att> used in the above example.</p></div><div><head>General-Purpose Interpretation Elements</head><p>A more general purpose segmentation element, the <gi>seg</gi> has
            already been introduced for use in identifying otherwise unmarked
            targets of cross references and hypertext links (see section <ptr target="#U5-ptrs"/>); it identifies some phrase-level portion of
            text to which the encoder may assign a user-specified
              <att>type</att>, as well as a unique identifier; it may thus be
            used to tag textual features for which there is no provision in the
            published TEI Guidelines.</p><p>For example, the Guidelines provide no
              <soCalled>apostrophe</soCalled> element to mark parts of a
            literary text in which the narrator addresses the reader (or hearer)
            directly. One approach might be to regard these as instances of the
              <gi>q</gi> element, distinguished from others by an appropriate
            value for the <att>who</att> attribute. A possibly simpler, and
            certainly more general, solution would however be to use the
              <gi>seg</gi> element as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="chapter" n="38"><p><seg type="apostrophe">Reader, I married him.</seg> A
                  quiet wedding we had: ...</p></div></egXML> The
              <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>seg</gi> element can take any
            value, and so can be used to record phrase-level phenomena of any
            kind; it is good practice to record the values used and their
            significance in the header.</p><p>A <gi>seg</gi> element of one type (unlike the <gi>s</gi> element
            which it superficially resembles) can be nested within a
              <gi>seg</gi> element of the same or another type. This enables
            quite complex structures to be represented; some examples were given
            in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> above. However, because it must
            respect the requirement that elements be properly nested, and may
            not cut across each other, it cannot cope with the common
            requirement to associate an interpretation with arbitrary segments
            of a text which may completely ignore the document hierarchy. It
            also requires that the interpretation itself be represented by a
            single coded value in the <att>type</att> attribute.</p><p>Neither restriction applies to the <gi>interp</gi> element, which
            provides powerful features for the encoding of quite complex
            interpretive information in a relatively straightforward manner.
                <specList><specDesc key="interp"/><specDesc key="interpGrp"/></specList> These elements allows the encoder to specify both
            the class of an interpretation, and the particular instance of that
            class which the interpretation involves. Thus, whereas with
              <gi>seg</gi> one can say simply that something is an apostrophe,
            with <gi>interp</gi> one can say that it is an instance (apostrophe)
            of a larger class (rhetorical figures).</p><p>Moreover, <gi>interp</gi> is an empty element, which must be linked
            to the passage to which it applies either by means of the
              <att>ana</att> attribute discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> above, or by means of its own <att>inst</att> attribute. This
            means that any kind of analysis can be represented, with no need to
            respect the document hierarchy, and also facilitates the grouping of
            analyses of a particular type together. A special purpose
              <gi>interpGrp</gi> element is provided for the latter purpose.</p><p>For example, suppose that you wish to mark such diverse aspects of
            a text as themes or subject matter, rhetorical figures, and the
            locations of individual scenes of the narrative. Different portions
            of our sample passage from <title>Jane Eyre</title> for example,
            might be associated with the rhetorical figures of apostrophe,
            hyperbole, and metaphor; with subject-matter references to churches,
            servants, cooking, postal service, and honeymoons; and with scenes
            located in the church, in the kitchen, and in an unspecified
            location (drawing room?).</p><p>These interpretations could be placed anywhere within the
              <gi>text</gi> element; it is however good practice to put them all
            in the same place (e.g. a separate section of the front or back
            matter), as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><back><div type="Interpretations"><p><interp xml:id="fig-apos-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="figureOfSpeech">apostrophe</interp><interp xml:id="fig-hyp-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="figureOfSpeech">hyperbole</interp><interp xml:id="set-church-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="setting">church</interp><interp xml:id="ref-church-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="reference">church</interp><interp xml:id="ref-serv-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="reference">servants</interp></p></div></back></egXML></p><p>The evident redundancy of this encoding can be considerably reduced
            by using the <gi>interpGrp</gi> element to group together all those
              <gi>interp</gi> elements which share common attribute values, as
            follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><back><div type="Interpretations"><p><interpGrp type="figureOfSpeech" resp="#LB-MSM"><interp xml:id="fig-apos">apostrophe</interp><interp xml:id="fig-hyp">hyperbole</interp><interp xml:id="fig-meta">metaphor</interp></interpGrp><interpGrp type="scene-setting" resp="#LB-MSM"><interp xml:id="set-church">church</interp><interp xml:id="set-kitch">kitchen</interp><interp xml:id="set-unspec">unspecified</interp></interpGrp><interpGrp type="reference" resp="#LB-MSM"><interp xml:id="ref-church">church</interp><interp xml:id="ref-serv">servants</interp><interp xml:id="ref-cook">cooking</interp></interpGrp></p></div></back></egXML></p><p>Once these interpretation elements have been defined, they can be
            linked with the parts of the text to which they apply in either or
            both of two ways. The <att>ana</att> attribute can be used on
            whichever element is appropriate: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="chapter" n="38"><p xml:id="P38.1" ana="#set-church #set-kitch"><s xml:id="P38.1.1" ana="#fig-apos">Reader, I married
                  him.</s></p></div></egXML> Note in this example that since the
            paragraph has two settings (in the church and in the kitchen), the
            identifiers of both have been supplied.</p><p>Alternatively, the <gi>interp</gi> elements can point to all the
            parts of the text to which they apply, using their <att>inst</att>
            attribute: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><interp xml:id="fig-apos-2" type="figureOfSpeech" resp="#LB-MSM" inst="#P38.1.1">apostrophe</interp><interp xml:id="set-church-2" type="scene-setting" inst="#P38.1" resp="#LB-MSM">church</interp><interp xml:id="set-kitchen-2" type="scene-setting" inst="#P38.1" resp="#LB-MSM">kitchen</interp></egXML></p><p>The <gi>interp</gi> is not limited to any particular type of
            analysis, The literary analysis shown above is but one possibility;
            one could equally well use <gi>interp</gi> to capture a linguistic
            part-of-speech analysis. For example, the example sentence given in
            section <ptr target="#xatts"/> assumes a linguistic analysis which
            might be represented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><interp xml:id="NP1" type="pos">noun phrase, singular</interp><interp xml:id="VV1" type="pos">inflected verb, present-tense singular</interp> ...
            </egXML></p></div></div><div xml:id="U5-techdoc"><head>Technical Documentation</head><p>Although the focus of this document is on the use of the TEI scheme
          for the encoding of existing <soCalled>pre-electronic</soCalled>
          documents, the same scheme may also be used for the encoding of new
          documents. In the preparation of new documents (such as this one), XML
          has much to recommend it: the document's structure can be clearly
          represented, and the same electronic text can be re-used for many
          purposes — to provide both online hypertext or browsable
          versions and well-formatted typeset versions from a common source for
          example. </p><p>To facilitate this, the TEI Lite schema includes some elements for
          marking features of technical documents in general, and of XML-related
          documents in particular.</p><div><head>Additional Elements for Technical Documents</head><p>The following elements may be used to mark particular features of
            technical documents: <specList><specDesc key="eg"/><specDesc key="code"/><specDesc key="ident"/><specDesc key="gi"/><specDesc key="att"/><specDesc key="formula"/><specDesc key="val"/></specList></p><p>The following example shows how these elements might be used to
            encode a passage from a tutorial introducing the Fortran programming
            language: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>It is
                traditional to introduce a language with a program like the
                following: <eg> CHAR*12 GRTG GRTG = 'HELLO WORLD' PRINT *, GRTG
                  END </eg></p><p>This simple example first declares a variable
                  <ident>GRTG</ident>, in the line <code>CHAR*12 GRTG</code>,
                which identifies <ident>GRTG</ident> as consisting of 12 bytes
                of type <ident>CHAR</ident>. To this variable, the value
                  <val>HELLO WORLD</val> is then assigned.</p></egXML></p><p>A formatting application, given a text like that above, can be
            instructed to format examples appropriately (e.g. to preserve line
            breaks, or to use a distinctive font). Similarly, the use of tags
            such as <gi>ident</gi> greatly facilitates the construction of a
            useful index.</p><p>The <gi>formula</gi> element should be used to enclose a
            mathematical or chemical formula presented within the text as a
            distinct item. Since formulae generally include a large variety of
            special typographic features not otherwise present in ordinary text,
            it will usually be necessary to present the body of the formula in a
            specialized notation. The notation used should be specified by the
              <att>notation</att> attribute, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><formula notation="tex">
                \begin{math}E = mc^{2}\end{math} </formula></egXML></p><p>A particular problem arises when XML encoding is the subject of
            discussion within a technical document, itself encoded in XML. In
            such a document, it is clearly essential to distinguish clearly the
            markup occurring within examples from that marking up the document
            itself, and end-tags are highly likely to occur. One simple solution
            is to use the predefined entity reference <code>&amp;lt;</code> to
            represent each &lt; character which marks the start of an XML tag
            within the examples. A more general solution is to mark off the
            whole body of each example as containing data which is not to be
            scanned for XML mark-up by the parser. This is achieved by enclosing
            it within a special XML construct called a <term><code>CDATA</code>
              marked section</term>, as in the following example: <eg>&lt;p&gt;A
              list should be encoded as follows: &lt;eg&gt;&lt;![ CDATA [
              &lt;list&gt; &lt;item&gt;First item in the list&lt;/item&gt;
              &lt;item&gt;Second item&lt;/item&gt; &lt;/list&gt; ]]&gt;
              &lt;/eg&gt; The &lt;gi&gt;list&lt;/gi&gt; element consists of a
              series of &lt;gi&gt;item&lt;/gi&gt; elements.</eg></p><p>The <gi>list</gi> element used within the example above will not be
            regarded as forming part of the document proper, because it is
            embedded within a marked section (beginning with the special markup
            declaration <val>&lt;![CDATA[ </val>, and ending with
              <val>]]&gt;</val>).</p><p>Note also the use of the <gi>gi</gi> element to tag references to
            element names (or <term>generic identifiers</term>) within the body
            of the text.</p></div><div><head>Generated Divisions</head><p>Most modern document production systems have the ability to
            generate automatically whole sections such as a table of contents or
            an index. The TEI Lite scheme provides an element to mark the
            location at which such a generated section should be placed.
                <specList><specDesc key="divGen"/></specList></p><p>The <gi>divGen</gi> element can be placed anywhere that a division
            element would be legal, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><front><titlePage><!-- ... --></titlePage><divGen type="toc"/><div><head>Preface</head><!-- ... --></div></front><body><!-- ... --></body><back><div><head>Appendix</head><!-- ... --></div><divGen type="index" n="Index"/></back></egXML></p><p>This example also demonstrates the use of the <att>type</att>
            attribute to distinguish the different kinds of division to be
            generated: in the first case a table of contents (a
              <mentioned>toc</mentioned>) and in the second an index.</p><p>When an existing index or table of contents is to be encoded
            (rather than one being generated) for some reason, the <gi>list</gi>
            element discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-lists"/> should be
            used. </p></div><div xml:id="indexing"><head>Index Generation</head><p>While production of a table of contents from a properly tagged
            document is generally unproblematic for an automatic processor, the
            production of a good quality index will often require more careful
            tagging. It may not be enough simply to produce a list of all parts
            tagged in some particular way, although extracting (for example) all
            occurrences of elements such as <gi>term</gi> or <gi>name</gi> will
            often be a good departure point for an index. </p><p>The TEI schema provides a special purpose <gi>index</gi> tag which
            may be used to mark both the parts of the document which should be
            indexed, and how the indexing should be done. <specList><specDesc key="index"/></specList></p><p>For example, the second paragraph of this section might include the
              following:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">... TEI
              lite also provides a special purpose <gi>index</gi> tag
                  <index><term>indexing</term></index>
              <index><term>index (tag)</term><index><term>use in index
                    generation</term></index></index> which may be used
              ...</egXML></p><p>The <gi>index</gi> element can also be used to provide a form of
            interpretive or analytic information. For example, in a study of
            Ovid, it might be desired to record all the poet's references to
            different figures, for comparative stylistic study. In the following
            lines of the <title>Metamorphoses</title>, such a study would record
            the poet's references to Jupiter (as <mentioned>deus</mentioned>,
              <mentioned>se</mentioned>, and as the subject of
              <mentioned>confiteor</mentioned> [in inflectional form number
            227]), to Jupiter-in-the-guise-of-a-bull (as <mentioned>imago tauri
              fallacis</mentioned> and the subject of
              <mentioned>teneo</mentioned>), and so on.<note place="foot">The

    <p>ISO 12620:2009 is a standard describing the data model and procedures for a Data
      Category Registry (DCR). Data categories are defined as elementary descriptors in a
      linguistic structure. In the DCR data model each data category gets assigned a
      unique Peristent IDentifier (PID), i.e., an URI. Linguistic resources or preferably
      their schemas that make use of data categories from a DCR should refer to them using
      this PID. For XML-based resources, like TEI documents, ISO 12620:2009 normative
      Annex A gives a small Data Category Reference XML vocabulary (also available online
      at <ref target="http://www.isocat.org/12620/">http://www.isocat.org/12620/</ref>),
      which provides two attributes, <att>dcr:datcat</att> and

      second is an integer. The value is obtained by multiplying the mantissa by 10 the number of
      times indicated by the integer. Thus the value represented in decimal notation as 1000.0 might
      be represented in scientific notation as 10E3.</p>
    <p>A value expressed as a ratio is represented by two integer values separated by a solidus (/)
      character. Thus, the value represented in decimal notation as 0.5 might be represented as a

    <p>The values for this attribute are language <soCalled>tags</soCalled> as defined in <ref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47</ref>. Currently BCP 47 comprises RFC 4646
      and RFC 4647; over time, other IETF documents may succeed these as the best current practice.</p>
    <p>A <soCalled>language tag</soCalled>, per BCP 47, is assembled from a sequence of components
      or <term>subtags</term> separated by the hyphen character (<mentioned>-</mentioned>, U+002D).
      The tag is made of the following subtags, in the following order. Every subtag except the
      first is optional. If present, each occurs only once, except the fourth and fifth components
      (variant and extension), which are repeatable. <list type="gloss">
        <label>language</label>
        <item>The IANA-registered code for the language. This is almost always the same as the ISO
          639 2-letter language code if there is one. The list of available registered language
          subtags can be found at <ptr target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry"/>. It is recommended
          that this code be written in lower case.</item>
        <label>script</label>
        <item>The ISO 15924 code for the script. These codes consist of 4 letters, and it is
          recommended they be written with an initial capital, the other three letters in lower
          case. The canonical list of codes is maintained by the Unicode Consortium, and is
          available at <ptr target="http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html"/>. The IETF
          recommends this code be omitted unless it is necessary to make a distinction you need.</item>
        <label>region</label>
        <item>Either an ISO 3166 country code or a UN M.49 region code that is registered with IANA
          (not all such codes are registered, e.g. UN codes for economic groupings or codes for
          countries for which there is already an ISO 3166 2-letter code are not registered). The
          former consist of 2 letters, and it is recommended they be written in upper case. The list
          of codes can be found at <ptr target="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/index.html"/>. The latter consist of 3 digits; the list of codes can be found at <ptr target="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm"/>.</item>
        <label>variant</label>
        <item>An IANA-registered variation. These codes <quote rend="quoted">are used to indicate
            additional, well-recognized variations that define a language or its dialects that are
            not covered by other available subtags</quote>.</item>
        <label>extension</label>
        <item>An extension has the format of a single letter followed by a hyphen followed by
          additional subtags. These exist to allow for future extension to BCP 47, but as of this
          writing no such extensions are in use.</item>
        <label>private use</label>
        <item>An extension that uses the initial subtag of the single letter
          <mentioned>x</mentioned> (i.e., starts with <code>x-</code>) has no meaning except as
          negotiated among the parties involved. These should be used with great care, since they
          interfere with the interoperability that use of RFC 4646 is intended to promote. In order
          for a document that makes use of these subtags to be TEI conformant, a corresponding
            <gi>language</gi> element must be present in the TEI header.</item>
      </list></p>
    <p>There are two exceptions to the above format. First, there are language tags in the <ref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry">IANA registry</ref> that
      do not match the above syntax, but are present because they have been
      <soCalled>grandfathered</soCalled> from previous specifications.</p>
    <p>Second, an entire language tag can consist of only a private use subtag. These tags start
      with <code>x-</code>, and do not need to follow any further rules established by the IETF and
      endorsed by these Guidelines. Like all language tags that make use of private use subtags, the
      language in question must be documented in a corresponding <gi>language</gi> element in the
      TEI header.</p>

        <quote>A regular expression, often called a <term>pattern</term>, is an expression that
          describes a set of strings. They are usually used to give a concise description of a set,
          without having to list all elements. For example, the set containing the three strings
            <mentioned>Handel</mentioned>, <mentioned>Händel</mentioned>, and
          <mentioned>Haendel</mentioned> can be described by the pattern <code>H(ä|ae?)ndel</code>

    <p>Degrees of uncertainty over what can still be read, or whether a deletion was intended may be
      indicated by use of the <gi>certainty</gi> element (see <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CE.html#CE">21. </ref>).</p>
    <p>This element should be used for deletion of shorter sequences of text, typically single words
      or phrases. The <gi>delSpan</gi> element should be used for longer sequences of text, for
      those containing structural subdivisions, and for those containing overlapping additions and
      deletions.</p>
    <p>The text deleted must be at least partially legible in order for the encoder to be able to
      transcribe it (unless it is restored in a <gi>supplied</gi> tag). Illegible or lost text within a 
      deletion may be marked using the <gi>gap</gi> tag to signal that text is present but has not
      been transcribed, or is no longer visible. Attributes on the <gi>gap</gi>
      element may be used to indicate how much text is omitted, the reason for omitting it, etc. If
      text is not fully legible, the <gi>unclear</gi> element (available when using the additional
      tagset for transcription of primary sources) should be used to signal the areas of text which
      cannot be read with confidence in a similar way.</p>
    <p>There is a clear distinction in the TEI between <gi>del</gi>, which is a statement of the
     the or a later scribe's intent to cancel or remove text, and elements such as 
      <gi>gap</gi> or <gi>unclear</gi> which signal the editor's decision to omit or inability to read the text
      remaining.
    See further sections <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHOM">11.3.1.7. </ref> and, for the close association of the
      <gi>del</gi> tag with the <gi>gap</gi>, <gi>damage</gi>,
        <gi>unclear</gi> and <gi>supplied</gi> elements (the latter three tags available when using
      the additional tagset for transcription of primary sources), <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHCOMB">11.3.3.2. </ref>.</p>
    <p>The <gi>del</gi> tag should not be used for deletions made by editors or encoders. In these
      cases, either <gi>corr</gi>, <gi>surplus</gi> or <gi>gap</gi> should be used.</p>
  </remarks><remarks xml:lang="fr">

    <p>Les degrés d'incertitude sur ce qui est encore lisible peuvent être indiqués par l'emploi de
      l'élément <gi>certainty</gi> (voir <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CE.html#CE">21. </ref>).</p>
    <p>Cet élément doit être utilisé pour la suppression de courtes séquences de texte, généralement
      des mots ou des expressions. Il faut utiliser l'élément <gi>delSpan</gi> pour les séquences de
      texte plus longues, celles qui contiennent des divisions structurelles, et celles qui
      contiennent un chevauchement d'ajouts et de suppressions.</p>
    <p>Le texte supprimé doit être au moins partiellement lisible, afin que l'encodeur soit en
      mesure de le transcrire. La partie illisible du texte à l'intérieur d'une suppression peut être
      marquée au moyen de la balise <gi>gap</gi> pour signaler la présence de texte non transcrit.
      La quantité de texte omise, la raison de l'omission, etc., peuvent être indiqués au moyen des
      attributs de l'élément <gi>gap</gi>. Si le texte n'est pas entièrement lisible, l'élément
        <gi>unclear</gi> (disponible avec le jeu additionnel de balises pour la transcription des
      sources primaires) doit être utilisé pour signaler les zones de texte ne pouvant pas être lues

        <p>The <att>type</att> attribute is provided for the sake of those who wish to
                    classify abbreviations at their point of occurrence; this may be useful in some
                    circumstances, though usually the same abbreviation will have the same type in
                    all occurrences. As the sample values make clear, abbreviations may be
                    classified by the method used to construct them, the method of writing them, or
                    the referent of the term abbreviated; the typology used is up to the encoder and
                    should be carefully planned to meet the needs of the expected use. For a
                    typology of Middle English abbreviations, see <ptr target="#PETTY"/>

                    ses occurrences. Comme les échantillons des valeurs le montrent, les
                    abréviations peuvent être typées selon la méthode utilisée pour leur
                    construction, pour leur écriture, ou le référent du terme abrégé ; la typologie
                    utilisée dépend de l'encodeur et doit être pensée soigneusement afin de

        <head>Athelstan's Ordinance</head>
        <list type="ordered">
          <item n="1">Concerning thieves. First, that no thief is to be spared who is caught with
            the stolen goods, [if he is] over twelve years and [if the value of the goods is] over
            eightpence. <list type="ordered"><item n="1.1">And if anyone does spare one, he is to pay for the thief with his
                wergild — and the thief is to be no nearer a settlement on that account — or to
                clear himself by an oath of that amount.</item><item n="1.2">If, however, he [the thief] wishes to defend himself or to escape, he is
                not to be spared [whether younger or older than twelve].</item><item n="1.3">If a thief is put into prison, he is to be in prison 40 days, and he may
                then be redeemed with 120 shillings; and the kindred are to stand surety for him
                that he will desist for ever.</item><item n="1.4">And if he steals after that, they are to pay for him with his wergild,
                or to bring him back there.</item><item n="1.5">And if he steals after that, they are to pay for him with his wergild,
                whether to the king or to him to whom it rightly belongs; and everyone of those who
                supported him is to pay 120 shillings to the king as a fine.</item></list>

          <item n="2">Concerning lordless men. And we pronounced about these lordless men, from whom
            no justice can be obtained, that one should order their kindred to fetch back such a
            person to justice and to find him a lord in public meeting. <list type="ordered"><item n="2.1">And if they then will not, or cannot, produce him on that appointed day,
                he is then to be a fugitive afterwards, and he who encounters him is to strike him
                down as a thief.</item><item n="2.2">And he who harbours him after that, is to pay for him with his wergild

          <item n="3">Concerning the refusal of justice. The lord who refuses justice and upholds
            his guilty man, so that the king is appealed to, is to repay the value of the goods and
            120 shillings to the king; and he who appeals to the king before he demands justice as
            often as he ought, is to pay the same fine as the other would have done, if he had
            refused him justice. <list type="ordered"><item n="3.1">And the lord who is an accessory to a theft by his slave, and it becomes
                known about him, is to forfeit the slave and be liable to his wergild on the first
                occasionp if he does it more often, he is to be liable to pay all that he owns.</item><item n="3.2">And likewise any of the king's treasurers or of our reeves, who has been
                an accessory of thieves who have committed theft, is to liable to the same.</item></list>

          <item n="4">Concerning treachery to a lord. And we have pronounced concerning treachery to
            a lord, that he [who is accused] is to forfeit his life if he cannot deny it or is

        <speaker> Sabine.</speaker>
        <p>Vraiment, il y a bien des nouvelles. Mon oncle veut résolûment que ma cousine épouse
            Villebrequin, et les affaires sont tellement avancées, que je crois qu'ils eussent été
            mariés dès aujourd'hui, si vous n'étiez aimé ; mais comme ma cousine m'a confié le
            secret de l'amour qu'elle vous porte, et que nous nous sommes vues à l'extrémité par
            l'avarice de mon vilain oncle, nous nous sommes avisées d'une bonne invention pour
            différer le mariage. C'est que ma cousine, dès l'heure que je vous parle, contrefait la
            malade ; et le bon vieillard, qui est assez crédule, m'envoie querir un médecin. Si vous
            en pouviez envoyer quelqu'un qui fût de vos bons amis, et qui fût de notre intelligence,
            il conseilleroit à la malade de prendre l'air à la campagne. Le bonhomme ne manquera pas
            de faire loger ma cousine à ce pavillon qui est au bout de notre jardin, et par ce moyen
            vous pourriez l'entretenir à l'insu de notre vieillard, l'épouser, et le laisser pester
            tout son soûl avec Villebrequin.</p>

          la droite si c'est nécessaire.</p>
        <p>Lorsqu'on cherche une référence, la longueur indique le nombre des caractères devant être

          cualquier caso, los componentes de la referencia se truncan en caso de necesidad por el
          lado derecho. </p>

        specify the location of digital objects representing the notated music in other media such
        as images or audio-visual files. The encoder's interpretation of the correspondence between
        the notated music and these digital objects is not encoded explicitly. We recommend the use
        of graphic and binaryObject mainly as a fallback mechanism when the notated music format is
        not displayable by the application using the encoding. The alignment of encoded notated
        music, images carrying the notation, and audio files is a complex matter for which we refer
        the encoder to other formats and specifications such as MPEG-SMR.</p></remarks></elementSpec><elementSpec module="figures" ident="figure"><equiv/><gloss versionDate="2007-06-12" xml:lang="fr">figure</gloss><desc>groups elements representing or containing graphic information

      enables recording of rendition information.

      <valDesc>one or more pointers to element(s) characterizing the conditions which
      are assumed in the assignment of a degree of confidence.</valDesc>
      <remarks>
        <p>The envisioned typical value of this attribute would be the
	identifier of another <gi>certainty</gi> element or a list of
	such identifiers. It may thus be possible to construct
	probability networks by chaining <gi>certainty</gi> elements
	together. Such networks would ultimately be grounded in
	unconditional <gi>certainty</gi> elements (with no value for
	<att>given</att>). The semantics of this chaining would be
	understood in this way: if a <gi>certainty</gi> element is
	specified, via a reference, as the assumption, then it is not
	the attribution of uncertainty that is the assumption, but
	rather the assertion itself. For instance, in the example
	above, the first <gi>certainty</gi> element indicates that the
	confidence in the identification of the new scribe as
	<mentioned>msm</mentioned>. The second indicates the degree of
	confidence that <mentioned>Essex</mentioned> is a personal
	name, given that the new scribe is <mentioned>msm</mentioned>.
	Note that the given in the second <gi>certainty</gi> element
	is not the assertion that the likelihood that msm is the new
	scribe is 0.6, but simply the assertion that msm is the new
	scribe; this is a recommended convention to facilitate
	building networks.</p>
        <p>The ambitious encoder may wish to attempt complex networks
or probability assertions, experimenting with references to
other elements or prose assertions, and deploying feature
structure connectives such as <gi>alt</gi>, <gi>join</gi>, and
<gi>note</gi>.  However, we do not believe that the
<gi>certainty</gi> element gives, at this time, a comprehensive
ambiguity-free system for indicating certainty.</p>
      </remarks>
      <remarks xml:lang="fr">
        
        <p>La valeur typique à laquelle on pense pour cet attribut
        serait l'identifiant d'un autre élément <gi>certainty</gi> ou
        une liste comportant de tels identifiants. Il serait ainsi
        possible de construire des réseaux de probabilité en chaînant
        ensemble des éléments <gi>certainty</gi>. Ces réseaux seraient
        en définitive fondés sur des éléments <gi>certainty</gi>
        inconditionnels (sans attribut <att>given</att>). La
        sémantique de ce chaînage est à comprendre ainsi : si un
        élément <gi>certainty</gi> est spécifié comme postulat au
        moyen d'une référence (présence d'un attribut
        <att>given</att>), alors l'assertion même constitue le
        postulat, et non pas l'attribution d'un caractère
        d'incertitude. Ainsi, dans l'exemple ci-dessus, le premier
        élément <gi>certainty</gi> formule l'hypothèse que le nouveau
        scripteur est <mentioned>msm</mentioned>. Le second indique le
        degré de confiance dans le fait que
        <mentioned>Essex</mentioned> est un nom de personne, étant
        donné que le nouveau scripteur est
        <mentioned>msm</mentioned>. Notons que le postulat dans le
        deuxième élément <gi>certainty</gi> n'est pas que le degré de
        probabilité que msm soit le nouveau scripteur est de 0.6, mais
        simplement que msm est le nouveau scripteur ; il est
        recommandé d'utiliser cette convention pour faciliter la
        construction de réseaux.</p>
        <p>Les encodeurs ambitieux peuvent souhaiter construire des
        réseaux ou des assertions de probabilité complexes, en faisant
        référence à d'autres éléments ou à des assertions en texte
        libre, et en établissant des relations entre structures de
        traits, telles que <gi>alt</gi>, <gi>join</gi> et
        <gi>note</gi>. Toutefois nous ne pensons pas que l'élément
        <gi>certainty</gi> procure actuellement un système complet et
        sans ambiguïté pour indiquer le degré de certitude.</p>

      ある要素<gi>certainty</gi>を前提条件として参照している場合，

    <p>As with other culturally-constructed traits such as
    age, the way in which this concept is described in different
    cultural contexts may vary. The normalizing attributes are

    inappropriate. The content of the element may be used to describe

    <p>Where there is confusion between <gi>trait</gi> and <gi>state</gi> the more general purpose
      element <gi>state</gi> should be used even for unchanging characteristics. If you wish to
      distinguish between characteristics that are generally perceived to be time-bound states and
      those assumed to be fixed traits, then <gi>trait</gi> is available for the more static of
      these. The <gi>state</gi> element encodes characteristics which are sometimes assumed to
      change, often at specific times or over a date range, whereas the <gi>trait</gi> elements are
      used to record characteristics, such as eye-colour, which are less subject to change. Traits are typically, but not necessarily, 
      independent of the volition or action of the holder.</p>
