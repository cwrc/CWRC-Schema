            <RESEARCHNOTE>This subsection (AUTHORSUMMARY) usually encloses summary statements (usually just one paragraph) about an author (a short preface) before opening the writing document of each woman writer. This element can contain a short writer profile, or an entry summary (similar to an abstract). It is useful both for minor writers about whom little is known, and for major writers whose work needs to be sumarized before launching into the details. </RESEARCHNOTE>

            <CULTURALFORMATION>
                <RESEARCHNOTE> CulturalFormation is a Div1 element that can be placed either around a general overview of a writer's identity positions or can act as the bucket that holds the more specific elements of religion, class, sexuality, race and ethnicity, and nationality. CulturalFormation is a Div1 content element. It has two levels of sub-elements. The first set contains the following anchored sub-elements (to be placed around structural tags) which have their own subject specific sub-elements: classIssue, nationalityIssue, raceAndEthnicity, religion, sexuality. If no sub-element from the first set is selected, the following sub-elements are available (to be placed around the identifying word or phrase): raceColour, class, nationalHeritage, nationality, geogHeritage, ethnicity, denomination, language, politicalAffiliation, sexualIdentity. Like most other semantic tags, this tag can be moved to another point in the entry, and it can be used more than once if needed at multiple points. Note that gender and nation are attributes on the highest level element at the very top, ENTRY.</RESEARCHNOTE>
