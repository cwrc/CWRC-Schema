                            <P>In her stage performances, PJ appeared in a buckskin dress of her own
                                design and manufacture for the first half of the show, and then
                                after a brief intermission, reappeared in a ball-gown (the costume
                                of a <RACECOLOUR FOREBEAR="MOTHER">white</RACECOLOUR> Victorian
                                woman) for the second half. Critic <NAME>Mary Elizabeth

                                Native disappearing into civilized late-Victorian culture. The
                                aboriginal outfit was, in a way, inauthentic: PJ collected artefacts
                                from several different First Nations, so it did not truly represent
                                Mohawk dress, for example. Among the accoutrements for this outfit
                                was a necklace made from the claws of a bear which may have been a
                                present from author and friend <NAME>Ernest Thompson Seton</NAME>.
                                PJ did affirm that Seton gave her a bracelet of elks' teeth and

                                father's knife at her belt, and a scarlet blanket. Her buckskin
                                dress was adorned with silver brooches, fringes, ermine tails,
                                rabbit pelts, her grandfather's Huron scalp, and another scalp
                                bought in the United States. PJ knew that audiences came, in part,
                                to see an Indian, and sometimes found herself described in

                    <SHORTPROSE>
                        <P>Her parents' wedding in 1853 attracted attention because an English
                            woman was marrying a Mohawk man. A minister who was the brother-in-law
                            of the bride refused to marry the couple and the wedding was held
                            outside of Brantford in a futile attempt to keep away the curious. To
                            calm some of the outraged Howells relatives, PJ's father wore an
                            outfit appropriate for a stylish British man: black silk hat and satin
                            waistcoat. PJ's Mohawk grandmother was also opposed to the marriage
                            because she did not want a non-Native person entering the prestigious
                            Johnson clan and because any children produced by the union would not
                            be, under traditional law, Mohawk.<BIBCITS>

                            PJ found a young doctor, <NAME>Thomas Ransom Biggar Nelles</NAME>, who
                            was not only highly qualified but had moved to Vancouver from Brantford.
                            He had the unhappy job of telling PJ that her cancer was beyond remedy:
                            all the help he could give her would be to manage pain.<BIBCITS>
