        <RESEARCHNOTE>This template provides sections for topics generally found in a writer's entry. Please note that any irrelevant tags or sections can simply be deleted when not applicable. You can also add other sections, with other available tags (see below) like INTIMATERELATIONSHIPS (non-familial intimate relationships; this tag has an attribute), FRIENDSASSOCIATES (close, and broader social circle), HEALTH (mental and physical health, including issues having to do with the female body; this tag has an attribute), LOCATION (travel, visits, moves, migrations, and residences; this tag has an attribute), POLITICS (political affiliations and degree of involvement in political organizations), LEISUREANDSOCIETY (social and leisure activities), VIOLENCE (any domestic or other violence), WEALTH (material wealth or poverty; significant changes in standard of living). N.b. insert a Chronstruct wherever you wish information to be tied to a date, available for pulling out into timelines (as in Birth and Death here. When in doubt over decisions, try looking at existing Orlando entries.</RESEARCHNOTE>
