Now each award/grant pertaining to a specific play will be located UNDER that play's information. GRH: If the playwright has included this info in their survey it will likely be listed at the bottom of this document and should be moved into this section.</RESEARCHNOTE>
                <RESEARCHNOTE>This "other" category does not have a corresponding question number because it was invented AFTER the survey was sent out. It is meant to grab infomation from the original "Other" category that contains information from specific to a play written by the playwright. It makes sense to have this information in the "play section" like this, rather than have only one "other" category.</RESEARCHNOTE>
