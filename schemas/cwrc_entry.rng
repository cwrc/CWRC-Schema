    * Purpose: RELAX NG schema to model CWRC entries (biography- and writing-related information about writers and historical figures)
    *
    * Description: A corpus of 3,263 Orlando biography documents (1,785) and writing documents (1,478) was used to generate a RELAX NG schema that
    * modeled the combined corpus of documents.  Modifications included the following:
    *     - default values for some attributes were defined;
    *     - enumerated lists of values for some attributes were defined; and
    *     - element and attribute documentation was introduced via the a:documentation element (with namespace "a" [for "annotation"]).  (Note: the
    *       documentation consists of the definition for that element or attribute taken from the Orlando Glossary or the TEI Guidelines.)
    *
    * Schema design pattern: Although the standard design pattern terminology found in the literature refers to, and is most appropriate for, W3C XML
    * Schema (XSD), there is some applicability when applied to the schema design patterns in RELAX NG (RNG).  The standard four schema design patterns
    * are the following: Russian Doll, Salami Slice, Venetian Blind, and Garden of Eden.  The CWRC entry schema uses the Salami Slice design with respect
    * to elements, wherein all elements are defined globally (the concept of "type", i.e., simple type and complex type, is only germane to XSD schemas).
    * All attributes are defined locally within each element (except for the @RESP attribute, which is defined globally).
    *     TEI-based approaches using modules, model classes, and attribute classes, were not required and thus not utilized.  Rather, the approach and
    * design philosophy of the original Orlando SGML DTDs was adopted: globally defining each element, and then defining the attributes associated with
    * each element.  The only difference in design approaches between the original Orlando SGML DTDs and the CWRC RELAX NG entry schema is that the SGML
    * DTDs defined the attributes for each element only once in the DTD in an ATTLIST declaration, whereas the attributes for an element are defined each
    * time the element is used in the RELAX NG schema; because the majority of attributes are defined and utilized only once in one specific element,
    * this is a viable approach.  Moreover, designing the schema in this manner has made possible the following improvements:
    *     - a more faithful adherence to the prescriptions of the original Orlando SGML DTDs;
    *     - an improved ability to modify and revise the schema;
    *     - the ability to generate documentation based on a W3C XML Schema version of this RELAX NG schema; and
    *     - performance improvements in terms of speed when referencing the schema from XML documents.

*** Revisions ***
* MRB: March 2015: Made the following changes:
  - Created a new element CHRONEVENT, that has child elements of CHRONSTRUCT, P, RESEARCHNOTE, BIBCITS, and KEYWORDCLASS; CHRONEVENT is available in
     the same elements that CHRONSTRUCT is available in; all child elements can only appear once, CHRONSTRUCT is required and must appear first, and the other child elements
     are optional and can appear in any order (i.e., are interleaved).
  - Created an attribute LAT in the element PLACE.

  - Created an attribute REG in the element TTHEMETOPIC.
  - Added the enumerated list of values from the entities.rng schema's orgType element to the attribute ORGTYPE in the element ORGNAME.
* MRB: December 2014: Made the following changes:
  - Added to the enumerated list of values for the attribute GENRENAME in the element TGENRE the following values: COLLECTIVECREATION, DANCE, MUSICAL, PHYSICALTHEATRE,
    PODPLAY, and THEATREFORYOUNGAUDIENCES.
  - Added to the enumerated list of values for the ROLE element the following values: Agent, Assistant director, Clown, Filmmaker, Mask designer, Performance artist, Playwright,

  - Made element AUTHORITY repeatable in the parent element CWRCHEADER.
  - Created the element PROFILEDESC, which is a child element of CWRCHEADER, and which has two child elements, LANGUSAGE and TEXTCLASS; the element LANGUSAGE
     has a repeatable child element LANG, and the element LANG has an optional attribute IDENT; the element TEXTCLASS has a repeatable child element KEYWORDS,
     and the element KEYWORDS has an optional attribute SCHEME, and a repeatable child element TERM.
* MRB: September 2014: Made the following changes:
  - Created the element IDNO, which is a child element of BIBCIT, and which has an attribute TYPE.
  - Made element LISTBIBCIT a child element of the following elements (including ENTRY): BIRTH, CULTURALFORMATION, DEATH, ECONOMICS, EDUCATION, FAMILY,
    FRIENDSASSOCIATES, HEALTH, INTIMATERELATIONSHIPS, LEISUREANDSOCIETY, OCCUPATION, OTHERLIFEEVENT, PERSONNAME, POLITICS, RESIDENCEANDMOBILITY,
    VIOLENCE, PRODUCTION, RECEPTION, and TEXTUALFEATURES.
  - Revised element CHRONSTRUCT so that DATE or DATERANGE is required, CHRONPROSE is required, the other child elements are optional and repeatable, and all child elements
    can be interleaved.
  - Made element AUTHORSUMMARY repeatable in the parent element ENTRY.
  - Created the element LISTBIBCIT, which is a child element of ENTRY, and which contains one or more BIBCIT or RESEARCHNOTE child elements.
  - Refined the element BIBCIT from a locally defined child element of BIBCITS, to a globally defined element which is a child element of BIBCITS and LISTBIBCIT.
  - Created the element FRONT, which is a child element of ENTRY, and which contains one or more of the following elements: CHRONSTRUCT, DATASTRUCT,
    HEADING, KEYWORDCLASS, P, and RESEARCHNOTE.
  - Removed references to the element BIBCITS from the following parent elements: BIRTH, CULTURALFORMATION, DATASTRUCT, DEATH, ECONOMICS, EDUCATION, ENTRY, FAMILY,
    FAMILYMEMBER, FRIENDSASSOCIATES, HEALTH, INTIMATERELATIONSHIPS, LEISUREANDSOCIETY, OCCUPATION, OTHERLIFEEVENT, PERSONNAME, POLITICS,
    RESIDENCEANDMOBILITY, SCHOLARNOTE, TEXTSCOPE, and VIOLENCE; two exceptions to the guiding principle that the parent element of BIBCITS must allow text are BIRTHNAME
    and CHRONSTRUCT.
  - Removed references to the element SCHOLARNOTE from the following parent elements: BIBCITS, BIRTH, CULTURALFORMATION, DATASTRUCT, DEATH, ECONOMICS, EDUCATION,
    ENTRY, FAMILY, FAMILYMEMBER, FRIENDSASSOCIATES, HEALTH, INTIMATERELATIONSHIPS, LEISUREANDSOCIETY, OCCUPATION, OTHERLIFEEVENT, PERSONNAME, POLITICS,
    RESIDENCEANDMOBILITY, TEXTSCOPE, VIOLENCE, and WORKSCITED; two exceptions to the guiding principle that the parent element of SCHOLARNOTE must allow text are
    BIRTHNAME and CHRONSTRUCT.
  - Redefined the attribute LEVEL in the element TITLE from an optional attribute to a required attribute.
* MRB: August 2014: Made the following changes:
  - Redefined the attribute VALUE in the element DATE so that the acceptable ISO date formats are explicitly defined, i.e., YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, and YYYY.
  - Redefined the attributes FROM and TO in the element DATERANGE so that the acceptable ISO date formats are explicitly defined, i.e., YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM,

            major biography elements defined as integral to mapping a woman&apos;s life. It refers to the constitution of a
            British Woman Writer&apos;s subjectivity and includes a number of different ways for you to talk about the
            pertinent issues. This element addresses the imbrication of the triad race/class/gender; it allows you to say
            &quot;She came from a Scottish dissenting family&quot; without having to separate the different elements that
            would be systematized as religion or raceEthnicity. We imagine that our use of the element will be consonant with
            the direction that scholarship is taking in its treatment of race, nationality, etc.: not treating them as
            transhistorical or isolated categories but looking at the way two or more categories intersect for a particular
            group at a particular historical period. We hope to provide our readers with two ways of accessing information
            around issues of a writer&apos;s subject positioning. Placing the identifying category elements around her
            religious denomination (&quot;Quaker&quot;), sexual identity (&quot;lesbian&quot;) or nationality
            (&quot;Scottish&quot;), for example, will point our end users toward writers whom they may be interested in
            researching if they were doing a project on any of these issues (for example, &quot;Contemporary Scottish
            women&apos;s writing&quot;). Placing a larger discussion within the general sub-elements (i.e., ClassIssue,
            Religion, etc.) will allow us to extract and merge all significant discussions of certain issues, providing our
            end users with a complex weave of information through which to analyse the construction of
            subjectivity.</a:documentation>

                            <a:documentation xmlns:a="http://relaxng.org/ns/compatibility/annotations/1.0">RaceAndEthnicity is a
                        significant sub-element within culturalFormation. It captures information and discussions of a
                        person&apos;s subject position with regards to race and ethnicity by working in conjunction with
                        subject specific sub-elements (raceColour, nationalHeritage, geogHeritage, ethnicity). The following
                        discussion applies to both the general discursive discussion of raceAndEthnicity as well as the
                        specific sub-element categories. Despite the anxieties of the ways in which categories of race or
                        ethnicity circulate and serve various kinds of undesirable interests, to ignore or go the totally
                        free-text route is not a responsible solution for this project, though it would certainly be easier
                        and simpler. The trick here is to make the complexities of the question of race and ethnicity emerge,
                        and to make it clear that these are shifting, historically constituted, and interestedly deployed
                        categories whose use must be understood contextually. The discursiveness with which we will present
                        these categories will, hopefully, help to do this and also allay the anxiety we feel about
                        &quot;labelling&quot; in a vacuum. In other words, the project has no notion that we could or should
                        come up with what is in any way an exact, fully defined, or mutually exclusive set of categories: the
                        point is the overlap within them. Within this system, counting per se becomes highly problematic and
                        the user has to do some work (and some thinking/active defining) before arriving at any kind of list
                        or count, and will hopefully arrive at it with a sense of how problematic such an activity is. We
                        want, as we go, to build carefully sets of associations for either the thesaurus or a specialized
                        search function, gradually building a set of lists, eventually with fleshed-out definitions, to
                        become glossary items attached to the terms that are hard to understand. People tagging will use what
                        terms seem to them to be right for the context, tagging with the category or categories within which
                        they seem to fit, but they should be encouraged not to let race/ethnicity become invisible or only an
                        issue in relation to the marginalized. If we think it will look silly if there is a statement in
                        entry after entry on British women writers saying that she was (presumably) white, I think
                        that&apos;s an indication of the force of biographical conventions and we should not let them dictate
                        our practices. And we should, as stressed by those concerned about &quot;white&quot; and
                        &quot;black&quot; as homogenizing categories, encourage people to reach for specificity through
                        multiplicity: i.e. generally attempt to include at least two of: &quot;race/colour&quot;;
                        &quot;ethnicity&quot;; &quot;nationality&quot; or &quot;national-heritage.&quot; Beginning with the
                        list started by the race-ethnicity subgroup, we have devised a structured vocabulary for these tags,
                        though the lists need not be mutually exclusive or even internally consistent. Thus
                        &quot;Jewish&quot; will appear in both &quot;race/colour&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; tag lists,
                        &quot;Ukrainian&quot; may appear in both &quot;national-heritage&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; tag
                        lists.</a:documentation>

                        issues (along with religion, race and ethnicity, language, class, and nationality) we have defined as
                        significant in discussing the cultural formation of a woman. This element captures discussions of her
                        sexuality as an identity or as an issue in her life. It is not meant to capture individual sexual
                        experiences and relationships (see intimateRelationships). Relationships with others should be
                        discussed here within the context of the effect on her life and the effect on her understanding of
                        her own sexuality. But descriptions of those relationships should be captured in
                        intimateRelationships. We are attempting, within this element, to gesture towards some of the
                        complicated issues around sexuality, for example, the politics of outing, the historical specificity
                        of some categories such as &quot;congenital invert,&quot; or the multiple forms of relating to
                        one&apos;s own sexuality. Capturing discussions of her sexuality within this element, will help

            enmities or associations that are not strictly friendships. It also provides a way to indicate that a woman
            writer had coffee with Samuel Johnson on one notable day, but that they weren&apos;t necessarily friends.
            Discussions of friendships or relationships that impinged upon the woman&apos;s sense of her own sexuality, would
            be best captured within either sexuality or intimateRelationships.</a:documentation>

            major biography elements defined as integral to mapping a woman&apos;s life. An intimate relationship is defined,
            for the purposes of this Project, as a relationship that involves any type of intimacy ranging from emotional to
            psychological to material and to sexual. This element seeks to counter the traditional assumption that
            women&apos;s only intimate relations happen within the context of marriage or heterosexual relations between
            sexual partners. It understands lifelong female friendships, defining psychological connections or
            erotically-charged same sex or opposite sex relationships as important to a woman&apos;s life. This element
            captures information concerning both brief sexual affairs and lifelong non-sexual relationships (see attribute
            erotic for distinguishing between the two). This element also seeks to redress the historical and ideological
            silence placed upon women&apos;s same-sex relationships; it recognizes that biographical information concerning
            these relationships often is impossible to uncover; therefore this element allows us to recognize these relations
            as significant while not assuming, in the absence of biographical proof, that they were sexual.</a:documentation>

                    intimateRelationships allows us to distinguish intimate relationships that were erotic and/or explicitly
                    sexual from intimate relationships that were not. Erotic in this context suggests that sexuality was an
                    issue in the relationship, whether or not it was acted upon in both same sex and opposite sex relations.
                    In not wishing to assume that heterosexual relations between sexual partners are the only standard for
                    intimate relationships, we include both erotic and non-erotic relations as central to a woman&apos;s life

                description of the text as object (bibliographic description). This category can address a singular text or a group of texts
                in cases where you want to make generalizations about oeuvre.</a:documentation>

                used to systematize the capture of dates across project documents. Date is used to tag all singular dates (not ranges).  Accurate
                and systematic tagging of dates by CWRC projects is a high priority both for the role that dates play in sorting and properly displaying
                chronology events, but also for facilitating the search and retrieval of non-chronology material across project documents.

            <a:documentation xmlns:a="http://relaxng.org/ns/compatibility/annotations/1.0">Place is a universal element, available throughout most XML
                elements, which structures information about geographical location. Locating events and people is a priority of CWRC projects. By
                emphasizing the facts of where events occurred, we will be able to bring together people and places, uncovering geographical connections
                between writers as yet undiscovered. <br/>There are two main goals for tagging place: mapping and indexing. We hope to automatically
                provide our end users with maps of literary history. For example, by using the places tagged with biography documents, we hope to
                generate a map for each woman writer&apos;s life which places her in specific places at specific times in her life. We also hope to
                allow end users to see a map of events for a particular year which would bring together geographical information from different CWRC
                projects. In order to automate mapping, it is crucial that we provide place information in a structured and recognizable way. In
                addition to mapping, we want to provide end users with an index of places. For example, we want to be able to index all women writers
                who lived in Bloomsbury or all events which took place in Bath. <br/>While we prioritize the tagging of place, not all places require
                tagging. We hope to enhance our geographical information by context specific tagging. For example, by tagging only places where events
                occurred inside Event chronstructs and not all places mentioned within the prose, we will be able to map that event to the place tagged.

                point our reader towards women writers whom they may be interested in studying in a critical analysis of these identifications. Capturing
                the term &quot;lesbian&quot; in a sexualIdentity tag does not signify that the subject of the biography was a lesbian; such
                identifications are often impossible for reasons of historical gaps and silences. It does suggest to our readers that if they are
                interested in studying lesbian issues, they may wish to look at this particular writer. We assume that sexual identity does not function
                in an essentialist manner and that to act monogomously does not reflect an essential, ontological state of being. But we are also
                assuming that issues of sexual identity influence a woman&apos;s relationship to her writing and to her life and therefore, we emphasize

                death. We wish to be able to compare writers who died from similar causes and trace significant historical factors contributing to
                women&apos;s deaths. For example, we are interested in which writers died of breast cancer and when and which women committed
