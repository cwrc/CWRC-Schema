    * Purpose: RELAX NG schema to model Orlando writing documents
    *
    * Description: A corpus of 1,477 Orlando writing documents was used to generate a RELAX NG schema that modeled the corpus of documents.
    * Modifications included the following:
    *     - default values for some attributes were defined;
    *     - enumerated lists of values for some attributes were defined; and
    *     - element and attribute documentation was introduced via the a:documentation element (with namespace "a" [for "annotation"]).  (Note: the
    *       documentation consists of the definition for that element or attribute taken from the Orlando Glossary or the TEI Guidelines.)
    *
    * Schema design pattern: Although the standard design pattern terminology found in the literature refers to, and is most appropriate for, W3C XML
    * Schema (XSD), there is some applicability when applied to the schema design patterns in RELAX NG (RNG).  The standard four schema design patterns
    * are the following: Russian Doll, Salami Slice, Venetian Blind, and Garden of Eden.  The Orlando writing schema uses the Salami Slice design with respect
    * to elements, wherein all elements are defined globally (the concept of "type", i.e., simple type and complex type, is only germane to XSD schemas).
    * All attributes are defined locally within each element (except for the @RESP attribute, which is defined globally).
    *     TEI-based approaches using modules, model classes, and attribute classes, were not required and thus not utilized.  Rather, the approach and
    * design philosophy of the original Orlando SGML DTDs was adopted: globally defining each element, and then defining the attributes associated with
    * each element.  The only difference in design approaches between the original Orlando SGML writing DTD and the Orlando RELAX NG writing schema is that
    * the SGML DTD defined the attributes for each element only once in the DTD in an ATTLIST declaration, whereas the attributes for an element are defined
    * each time the element is used in the RELAX NG schema; because the majority of attributes are defined and utilized only once in one specific element,
    * this is a viable approach.  Moreover, designing the schema in this manner has made possible the following improvements:
    *     - a more faithful adherence to the prescriptions of the original Orlando SGML writing DTD;
    *     - an improved ability to modify and revise the schema;
    *     - the ability to generate documentation based on a W3C XML Schema version of this RELAX NG schema; and
    *     - performance improvements in terms of speed when referencing the schema from XML documents.

                    (i.e. level-0 text division) is the largest structural element permitted in any
                    document. XML works on the principle that all information in a document exists
                    hierarchically, or, stated otherwise, that all types of information can be
                    contained in other types of information. For CWRC projects, Div0 is the element

                identifies the work under discussion in a Div 2. Structurally, TextScope resembles
                Bibcit in many ways: in a writing document, the TextScope tag itself is empty and
                most of the pertinent information is contained in attributes. Textscope has two key
                attributes: DBREF, which contains the dbref number of the corresponding bibliography
                item in the bibl database, and PLACEHOLDER, which contains a brief mention of the
                work under discussion and consists of the BWW's initials, a short title, and
                date.<br/> This element must be used in conjunction with a Div 2. You may not use it
                at the Div 1 level. You do not need to use a TextScope for each individual text you
                are discussing, or even for each text to which you devote an entire Div 2. Use the
                TextScope to demarcate discussions of major texts only. A useful rule of thumb is to
                consider whether you would enter the work under discussion in the bibliography
                database. If you would, then use a textscope for your discussion. Minor works would
                not be entered in the bibliography database and so do not require a textscope.<br/>
                The TextScope is not the same as a heading (and in fact may directly repeat your
                heading). Instead, the textScope demarcates the main discussion of a text for
                searching/indexing purposes. It is also used as a bibliographic pointer that will
                invisibly direct end-users to the bibliographic information about the text under
                discussion. The textScope tag will not appear in the reader's version of your
                document. It is an invisible tag for linking and searching
                purposes.</a:documentation>

        <element name="PLACE">
            <a:documentation xmlns:a="http://relaxng.org/ns/compatibility/annotations/1.0">Place is
                a universal element, available throughout most Orlando Project XML elements, which
                structures information about geographical location. Locating events and people is a
                priority of our Project. By emphasizing the facts of where events occurred, we will
                be able to bring together people and places, uncovering geographical connections
                between writers as yet undiscovered. <br/>There are two main goals for tagging
                place: mapping and indexing. We hope to automatically provide our end users with
                maps of literary history. For example, by using the places tagged with biography
                documents, we hope to generate a map for each woman writer&apos;s life which places
                her in specific places at specific times in her life. We also hope to allow end
                users to see a map of events for a particular year which would bring together
                geographical information from all Project documents. In order to automate mapping,
                it is crucial that we provide place information in a structured and recognizable
                way. In addition to mapping, we want to provide end users with an index of places.
                For example, we want to be able to index all women writers who lived in Bloomsbury
                or all events which took place in Bath. <br/>While we prioritize the tagging of
                place, not all places require tagging. We hope to enhance our geographical
                information by context specific tagging. For example, by tagging only places where
                events occurred inside Event chronstructs and not all places mentioned within the
                prose, we will be able to map that event to the place tagged. </a:documentation>

                            a sub-element within place, captures specific and easily identifiable
                            places that are known by their name but are not places in the same way
                            geographical or political entities are places. For example, "Trafalgar
                            Square" is a placename. We are only interested in capturing placenames
                            for those places that are important to women's literary history (i.e.,
                            those placenames that are likely to come up more than once in Orlando).
                            For example, Sissinghurst, the estate of Vita Sackville-West, is
                            significant and should be given a placename. However, an obscure
                            reference to an unknown estate should not be tagged. The following are
                            common types of placenames: Buildings and Estates: British Museum,
                            Knole; Farms and Gardens: Kew Gardens; Squares: Bedford Square,
                            Trafalgar Square; Streets: Fleet Street, The Strand, Old Change;
                            Specific Mountains: while ranges are considered regions, the names of
                            specific mountains are placenames, for example, Mount Everest;
                            Cemeteries: Paddington Cemetery.</a:documentation>

                        situations where the prose does not allow the concise naming of a genre that
                        would be easily understood by a simpler name. Ultimately, this attribute
                        will help us systematize and index references to various genre
